<p class="pc4 xlarge">HEART’S KINDRED</p>

<h2>I</h2>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">A hut</span> of bark, thatched with palm-leaves;
a gigantic rock at whose base lay old ashes;
an open grassy space bordering a narrow
mountain stream, and a little garden&mdash;these
made the home of the Inger, where a
man might live and die as a man was meant,
neither planning like a maniac nor yet idling
like an idiot, but well content with what the
day brought forth.</p>

<p>Toward a June sunset, the Inger sat outside
his doorway, fashioning a bowl from
half a turtle shell. Before him the ground
sloped down to the edge of the garden, and
beyond dropped to the clearing’s edge. When
he lifted his eyes, he could look for miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>along thick tops of live oaks and larches, and
beyond to a white line of western sea. At
his back rose the foothills, cleft by cañons
still quite freshly green. Above them, the
monstrous mountains swept the sky, and
here their flanks were shaggy with great
pines. The whole lay now in that glory of
clear yellow by which the West gives to the
evenings some hint of a desert ancestry.</p>

<p>The Inger worked in silence. He was
not a man to sing or whistle&mdash;those who
live alone are seldom whistling men. Perhaps
the silence becomes something definite,
and not lightly to be shattered. A man
camping alone will work away quietly day-long&mdash;and
his dog understands. The Inger
had no dog any more. He had owned a
wolf hound whom, in a fit of passion, he
had kicked so that the dog had died. And
such was his remorse that he would own no
other, and the sight of another man’s dog
pulled at him as at an old wound.</p>

<p>It was so still that, presently, in that clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>air the sound of a bell in the valley came up
to him with distinctness. He looked to the
south, and in a deep place in the trees, already
lights twinkled out as if they, like the
bells, would announce something. The Inger
remembered and understood.</p>

<p>“Hell,” he said aloud. “The wedding.”</p>

<p>He went on scraping at his turtle shell,
his mind on the man who would be married
that night&mdash;early, so that there would be
ample time for much merrymaking and
drunkenness before the east bound train at
midnight. Bunchy Haight was the man,
the owner of the run-down inn in the village
of Inch. The woman was the Moor girl,
whose father, abetted by the Inger himself,
had killed a sheriff or two for interfering
with his gambling place and had gone free,
because no one was sure whether it was he
or the Inger who did the shooting. Moor’s
promissory notes had been accumulating in
the hands of Bunchy Haight for a dozen
years, and it was no secret that the wedding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>settled the long score.</p>

<p>“And in dead luck to get a good provider
like Bunchy, the Moor girl is,” was the way
Inch took it.</p>

<p>Inch welcomed a wedding. In the old
days it had been different, and nobody cared
whether anybody had a wedding or not.
For then there had been a race track at
Inch, and a summer hotel, and a fine glass-front
showing of saloons, and other magnificence.
With the passing of the California
law, the track had been closed, the resort
keepers had moved away, and the bottom
had fallen from Inch.</p>

<p>Mothers amused their children by telling
of the traps and the four-in-hands and the
tally-ho’s with rollicking horns, and the
gaily dressed strangers who used to throng
the town for a fortnight in Spring and in
Autumn, when Inch knew no night and no
darkness and no silence, and abundantly
prospered.</p>

<p>Now all this was changed. There were,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>literally, no excitements save shootings and
weddings. Jem Moor, being supposed to
have achieved his share of the former, was
prepared further to adorn his position by
setting up drinks for the whole village and
all strangers, to celebrate his daughter’s
nuptial day.</p>

<p>These things the Inger turned over in his
mind as he scraped away at his shell; and
when the dark had nearly fallen, he rose,
shook out from the shell the last fragments,
polished it with his elbow, balanced it between
his hands to regard it, and came to
his conclusion:</p>

<p>“Hell,” he said again, “I’m bust if I
don’t go to it.”</p>

<p>The next instant he laid down the shell,
slipped to his door and caught up the gun
that lay inside, on a shelf of the rude
scantling. A wood duck had appeared over
the lower tree tops, flying languidly to its
nest, somewhere in the foothills. Long before
it reached the wood’s edge, the Inger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>was in his doorway. The bird’s heavy
flight led straight across the clearing. One
moment the big body came sailing above
the hut, then it seemed to go out in a
dozen ugly angles and dropped like a stone
to the edge of the garden. It lay fluttering
strongly when the Inger reached it.
He lifted and examined it approvingly.
One wing was shot almost clear of the body.
That was the mark he liked to make. He
swung the bird under his arm, took out his
jack-knife, pried open the mouth, slit the
long tongue, tied the feet together and hung
it outside his door to bleed to death. This
death, he had heard, improved the flavor.</p>

<p>Without washing his hands, he prepared
his supper&mdash;salt pork and bacon fried together,
corn cakes soaked in the gravy, and
coffee. The fire glowed in the hollow of
the great rock, and the smell of the cooking
crept about. The Inger was almost ready
to eat by the clear light of the transparent
sky, when he saw a figure coming across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>the clearing.</p>

<p>He leapt for his rifle&mdash;since the last
sheriff had been shot he was never perfectly
at ease with any stranger. But before his
hand had closed, it relaxed at the sound of
a triple whistle. He wheeled and looked
again. The stranger had almost reached
the bourne of the firelight.</p>

<p>“Blast my bones and blast me!” cried the
Inger. “Dad!”</p>

<p>Something deep and big had come in his
voice. As the two men met and shook
hands, there was a gladness in them both.
They moved apart in a minute, the Inger
took the pack which the older man swung
off, and went about cutting more salt pork
and bacon. His father found the wash basin,
and washed, breathing noisily through the
water cupped in his hands. Not much was
said, but any one would have known that
the two were glad of the moment.</p>

<p>“Not much grub,” said his father. “I
ain’t grub hungry,” and flung himself on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>the ground before the camp fire. “I’m
dead beat&mdash;and my bones ache,” he
added.</p>

<p>The Inger filled his father’s plate and went
on frying meat. In the firelight, their faces
looked alike. The older man’s skin was
beginning to draw tightly, showing the rugged
modelling of the thick bones. His huge
hands looked loose and ineffectual. Something
welled up and flooded the Inger when
he saw his father’s hand tremble as it lifted
his tin cup.</p>

<p>Larger in scale, more definite in drawing,
and triumphantly younger the Inger was,
brown skinned, level eyed, and deep chested,
his naked, veined right arm grasping the
handle of the skillet as if it were a battering
ram. When the Inger registered in the
inn at Inch or signed a check in his bank in
the City, his pen bit through the paper like
acid, because he did everything as if his tool
were a battering ram. But his eyes, as they
rested now on his father’s hand that trembled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>were soft and mute, like a dog’s eyes.</p>

<p>“What kind of luck, Dad?” he said.</p>

<p>The older man looked across his wooden
platter and smiled whimsically.</p>

<p>“Same kind,” he answered. “None. But
look a-here, Sonny&mdash;” he added, “I found
out something.”</p>

<p>“I bet you did,” said the Inger.</p>

<p>“I ain’t ever going to have any luck,”
said the old man. “I’m done for. I’m done.
A year or two more and I’ll be spaded in.
It’s the darndest, funniest feeling,” he said
musingly, “to get on to it that you’re all in&mdash;a
back number&mdash;got to quit plannin’ it.”</p>

<p>“Not on your life&mdash;” the Inger began,
but his father roared at him.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” he said fondly. “You danged
runt you, you must have knowed it for two
years back.”</p>

<p>“Knowed nothin’,” said the Inger, stoutly.</p>

<p>The older man put his plate on the ground
and lay down beside it, his head on his hand.</p>

<p>“It’s a devil of a feel,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>“Don’t feel it,” said the Inger.</p>

<p>“Cut it,” said his father, almost sternly.
“I brought you up to kill a man if you have
to&mdash;but not to lie to him, ain’t I? Well,
don’t you lie to me now.”</p>

<p>The Inger was silent, and his father went on.</p>

“I was always so dead sure,” he said, “that
<p>I was cut out to be rich. When I was a kid
in the tannery, I was dead sure. When I hit
the trail for the mines I thought the time was
right ahead. That was fifty years ago....”</p>

<p>“Quit, Dad,” said the Inger, uncomfortably.
“I’ve got it&mdash;what’s the difference?
The Flag-pole is good for all either of us will
ever want.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t forgot, though,” said the older
man, quickly, “that you banked on the
Flag-pole agin’ my advice. If you’d done as
I said, you’d been grubbin’ yet, same as me.”</p>

<p>“It’s all luck,” said the Inger. “What can
anybody tell? We’re gettin’ the stuff&mdash;and
there’s a long sight more’n we need.
Ain’t that enough? What you want to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>wear yourself out for?”</p>

<p>His father leaned against the end of the
warm rock, and lighted his pipe.</p>

<p>“Did I say I wanted to?” he asked. “I
done it so long I can’t help myself. I’ll be
schemin’ out deals, and bein’ let in on the
ground floor, and findin’ a sure thing till I
croak. <i>And</i> gettin’ took in, regular.”</p>

<p>He regarded his son curiously.</p>

<p>“What you goin’ to do with your pile?”
he inquired.</p>

<p>The Inger sat clasping his knees, looking
up at the height of Whiteface, thick black
in the thin darkness. His face was relaxed
and there was a boyishness and a sweetness
in his grave mouth.</p>

<p>“Nothin’,” he said, “till I get the pull to
leave here.”</p>

<p>“To leave Inch?” said his father, incredulously.</p>

<p>“To leave here,” the Inger repeated, throwing
out his arm to the wood. “This is good
enough for me&mdash;for a while yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>“I thought mebbe the society down there,”
said his father, with a jerk of his head to the
lights in the valley, “was givin’ you some
call to sit by.”</p>

<p>The Inger sprang up.</p>

<p>“So it is,” he said, “to-night. Bunchy’s
gettin’ spliced.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the antagonist?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“The Moor girl,” said the Inger. “Bunchy’s
a fine lot to draw her,” he added. “She’s
too good a hand for him. Want to go down
and see it pulled off?” he asked.</p>

<p>His father hesitated, looking down the
valley to the humble sparkling of Inch.</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon I really <i>want</i> to get drunk
to-night,” he said slowly. “I’ll save up till
I do.”</p>

<p>The Inger stretched prodigiously, bunching
his great shoulders, lifting his tense arms,
baring their magnificent muscles.</p>

<p>“I gotta, I guess,” he said. “But, gosh,
how I hate it.”</p>

<p>He carried the remnants of the food into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>the hut, and made his simple preparation for
festivity. As he emerged he was arrested
by a faint stirring and fluttering. He listened
and it was near at hand, and then he saw the
wood duck, writhing at the end of the string
that bound its legs. Beneath it lay a little
dark pool.</p>

<p>“No sense in bleedin’ <i>all</i> the good out of
ye,” thought the Inger, and with the butt of
the six-shooter that he was pocketing, he
struck the bird a friendly blow on the head
and stilled it.</p>

<p class="p2">The forest lay in premature night, save
where a little mountain brook caught and
treasured the dying daylight. It was intensely
still. The Inger’s tread and brushing
at the thickets silenced whatever movement
of tiny life had been stirring before him.
The trail wound for half a mile down the
incline, in the never-broken growth.</p>

<p>Once in the preceding winter when the
Flag-pole mine was at last known with certainty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>to be the sensation of the year, the
Inger had sewed a neat sum in the lining of
his coat and had gone to inspect San Francisco.
He had wanted to see a library, and
he saw one, and stood baffled among books
of which he had never heard, stammering
before a polite young woman who said, “Make
out your card, please, over there, and present
it at the further desk.” He had wanted to
see an art gallery, and he went confused
among alien shapes and nameless figures, and
had obediently bought a catalogue, of which
he made nothing. Then he had gone to
dinner with the family of one of the stockholders,
and had suffered anguish among
slipping rugs and ambiguous silver. The
next night, the new collar and cravat discarded,
he had turned up in one of his old
haunts on the Barbary Coast. On his experience
he made only one comment:</p>

<p>“They know too damn much, and there’s
too damn much they don’t know,” he said.</p>

<p>But the woods he understood. All that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>he had hoped to feel in the library and the
art gallery and in that home, he felt when
the woods had him. Out there he was his
own man.</p>

<p>As he went he shouted out a roaring music-hall
song. Then when he had ceased, as if
he became conscious of some incongruity, he
stood still, perhaps with some vague idea of
restoring silence. In a moment, he heard
something move in the tree above his head&mdash;an
anxious “Cheep&mdash;cheep!” in the leaves,
as if some soft breast were beating in fear
and an inquiring head were poised, listening.
Instantly he lifted his revolver and fired, and
fired again. He heard nothing. Had anything
fallen, he could certainly not have
come upon it next day. It was the need to
do something.</p>

<p>As he cleared the wood, the lights of the
town lay sparkling in a cup of the desert.
At sight of them there was something that
he wanted to do or to be. The vastness of
the sky, the nearness of the stars, the imminence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>of people, these possessed him. He
caught off his cap, and broke into a run, tossing
back his hair like a mane.</p>

<p>“Damn that little town&mdash;damn it, damn
it!” he chanted, like an invocation to the
desert and to the night.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">II</h2>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Inch</span> was in glory. On the little streets and
in the one-story shops, all the lights were
kindled. Bursts of music, and screaming
laughter, came from the saloons, whose doors
stood wide open to the street, and at whose
bars already men and women were congregating.
In the Mission Saloon, the largest
of these hospitable places, an impromptu stage
had been arranged, and the seats about the
tables were nearly all filled. Here the Inger
went in and called for his first drink, negligently
including everybody present. He was
greeted boisterously by those who knew him
and pointed out to those who did not know
him. Not one of them understood the sources
of his power, or what it signified. He was
the only man in the county to be called by
his last name and the definite article. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>was a title of which a man might be proud,
conferred upon him by common consent of
his peers.</p>

<p>There was no formality of introduction.
The Inger merely scanned the crowd, flashing
a smile at one or two of the women who
nearly pleased him. When the drinking began,
it was to one of these that he lifted his glass.
But when immediately she came and sat
beside him, linking her arm in his, he drew
away laughing, and addressed the crowd at
large.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” he demanded. “What’s
doin’?”</p>

<p>“B-basket o’ peaches,” volunteered one of
the cow punchers, who early in the day had
begun to observe the occasion. “B-Bunchy’s
complimumps!”</p>

<p>When the improvised curtain of sheets
drew back, revealing ten or twelve half-clothed
strange women, the Inger understood.
This was Bunchy’s magnanimous
contribution to the general jollity of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>marriage night.</p>

<p>“Let me have an absinthe,” he said to the
barkeeper.</p>

<p>The man leaned across the bar and whispered
something.</p>

<p>“No absinthe!” shouted the Inger. “What
the hell kind of a joint is this?”</p>

<p>“Leadpipe Pete licked up the bottom of
the bottle,” growled the barkeeper, pointing
with the stump of a thumb.</p>

<p>The Inger looked. Beside him a big ranchman,
swarthy and sweaty and hairy, was
just lifting to his lips a tall tumbler of the
absinthe. He leered at the Inger, closed one
eye, and began to drink luxuriously. The
Inger leapt a pace backward; and in an
instant a bullet crashed through the glass,
shattered it, and the man stood, dripping,
with the bottom of the tumbler in his hand.
The bullet buried itself in the tin mirror of
the bar.</p>

<p>“About how much do I owe you for the
lookin’ glass?” inquired the Inger, easily,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>resting his elbows on the bar. “And charge
me up with Pete’s drink he’s mussed himself
up with so bad. What’ll be the next one,
Pete?”</p>

<p>“Leave Pete name the damages,” said the
barkeeper, unconcernedly wiping up the
liquid.</p>

<p>“You’re too hellish handy with your tools,
you are,” grumbled Pete, combing the glass
from his beard. “Make it brandy, neat.”</p>

<p>“Brandy, neat, one two,” repeated the
Inger. “<i>Bein’</i> your absinthe has run out.</p>”

<p>Presently he strolled up the street toward
the hotel, where the evening’s interest centred.
He glanced indifferently into the saloons,
nodded a greeting when he wished,
but more often ignored one. At a corner a
beggar, attracted to the little place from
some limbo where news of the wedding had
filtered, held out his cap.</p>

<p>“It’s my thirty-third birthday to-day,
pal,” he said. “It’ll bring you good luck
to cough up somethin’ on me, see if it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>don’t.”</p>

<p>The Inger stopped with simulated interest.
The man&mdash;a thin, degenerate creature, with
a wrinkled smile&mdash;approached him hopefully.
Abruptly the Inger’s powerful arm
shot out, caught him below the waist, lifted
him squirming in the air, and laid him carefully
in the gutter.</p>

<p>“What you need is rest,” he said, with
perfect gentleness, and left him there.</p>

<p>The hotel where the wedding was to be
celebrated had light in every window. Here
Bunchy’s preparations had been prodigal.
Blankets and skins lined the walls and covered
the floor of the office where a fire was
roaring and the card tables were in readiness.
Shouting and imprecation, chiefly from women,
came from the kitchen, where the wedding
supper was in preparation. In the hotel desk
was Bunchy himself, engaged in somewhat delayed
attention to his nails. His hair, still
wet from its brushing, ran away from his
temples, lifting the corners of his forehead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>so that it seemed to be smiling. He had a
large face, and a little tight mouth, with
raw-looking, shiny lips. There was something
pathetic in his careful black clothes
and his uncomfortable collar and his plaid
cravat.</p>

<p>“How much would you sink to back out?”
was the Inger’s salutation.</p>

<p>Bunchy grinned sheepishly.</p>

<p>“How much did it cost you?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Done it for nothing,” the Inger declared.
“I ain’t the charmer you are, Bunchy. Never
was.”</p>

<p>The groom leaned nearer the light, minutely
examining a black, cracked finger.</p>

<p>“She ain’t goin’ to be very much in the
way,” said he, confidentially.</p>

<p>“What?” asked the Inger, attentively.</p>

<p>Bunchy shook his head, pursing the tight,
raw lips.</p>

<p>“Not her,” he said. “She believes anything
you tell her&mdash;the whole works. There
won’t never be no kickin’ from her about me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>not loafin’ home.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Inger, still with minute
attention, “what you gettin’ married for,
then?”</p>

<p>“Huh?” said Bunchy, an obstinate finger
between his lips.</p>

<p>“I thought,” explained the Inger, “that
a fellow got married for to have a home.
Far as I can see, though,” he added with
an air of great intellectual candor, “home is
hell.”</p>

<p>Bunchy threw back his head and looked
at him. Curiously, when he laughed, his
little tight mouth revealed no teeth. His
answer was deliberate, detailed, unspeakable.</p>

<p>For a minute the Inger looked at him,
quietly, himself wondering at the surge of
something hot through all his veins. In his
slow swing round the end of the desk where
Bunchy stood, there was no hint of what he
meant to do. Bunchy did not even look up
from the fat forefinger which he scrupulously
pruned. Nor was there anything passionate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>in the Inger’s voice when he spoke.</p>

<p>“You ain’t got the time to-night,” he said,
“but when you get back from your honeymoon,
look me up and&mdash;<i>remember this</i>!”</p>

<p>The last words came with a rush, as the
Inger lifted his hand, and with his open
palm, struck Bunchy full in the face. He
struck harder than he had intended, and the
blood spurted. Even as he caught the ugly
look of wrath and amazement in that face,
the Inger tore the handkerchief knotted
about his own neck and wiped the blood from
Bunchy’s chin.</p>

<p>“No call to splash on the weddin’-finery,”
the Inger said, with compunction. “Any
time’ll do to bleed. She’s Jem Moor’s girl&mdash;you
hound!” he blazed out again, and flung
toward the door.</p>

<p>Bunchy, having recovered his speech, gave
vent to it long and variously. All that he
said was worse than the observation which
had caused his trouble. In the doorway, the
Inger halted and turned, and listened. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>seemed to be seeing Bunchy for the first
time. And yet he had heard all this from
the man scores of times before, and for that
matter, from all the men of Inch. But this
was about Jem Moor’s girl.</p>

<p>As he passed into the street, he wondered
at himself. Though she had been a familiar
figure ever since he had lived near Inch, he
had spoken to the girl no more than twice:
once when he had come riding into town from
the camp, warm with the knowledge, not
yet quite certainty, that the Flag-pole was
to pan out, Lory Moor had crossed his path
singing, a great coil of clothes-line over one
bare arm, the other hand fastening her hair.
The Inger, inwardly exultant with life and
his lot, had called out to her in the manner
of his kind:</p>

<p>“Hello, sweetie! What you got for me
this morning?”</p>

<p>Without lowering her brown arm, she had
looked up at him, and he had been startled
by the sheer ripe loveliness of her. While
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>he stared, wholly unprepared for her sudden
movement, a twist of wrist and a fling of
hand had let out the length of rope, and it fell
in a neat lasso about his neck.</p>

<p>“This!” she said and laughed. He had
never forgotten her laugh. Once or twice
afterward he had ineffectually tried to mock
its scale, softly, in his throat.</p>

<p>“Done,” cried the Inger, “and by the
Lord Harry, now you take me along with
you!”</p>

<p>At this her laughter had doubled, and realizing
that, in her obvious advantage, his command
was absurd, he had laughed with her.
For a few paces she had run before him, over
the sand and mesquite, and he had liked to
see the sun falling on her brown neck and
thick hair, and her tight, torn sleeves. And
as he looked and looked, suddenly he pricked
at his horse, thundered down on her, leaned
sideways in his saddle, and with one arm
swept her up before him.</p>

<p>She did not cry out, but her laughter was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>suddenly silenced, and she looked in his face,
swiftly and searchingly, as if to read it
through. She disdained to cling to him, and
sat erect, but her body was in his arm, and
with his free hand he gathered in the rope
and held it bunched on his mare’s neck.
Then they galloped. They were a quarter of
a mile from the town, and they took a great
circle about it. When she saw what he
meant to do, her tenseness relaxed, and she
sat at ease, but still she did not speak nor
did he. The Inger threw back his head, and
felt the ground leave his horse’s hoofs, and
felt the sky come near. He swam in the sun
and the sands blurred, and there was nothing
but the girl and the gallop of his horse. And
then suddenly, as they bore toward the
town, he had been intoxicated to see her
throw out her arms, toss them out and up,
and laugh again.</p>

<p>Had not the appraisers been waiting at the
hotel for him, the Inger might have turned to
the desert with her. As it was, at the edge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>of the settlement, where she suddenly and
imperiously pointed, he set her down, ducking
from the loop of rope and tossing it to
her when she had dismounted.</p>

<p>“You took me along with you all right,”
he reminded her.</p>

<p>She laughed and ran away.</p>

<p>“What have you got for me now?” the
Inger called after her.</p>

<p>“This!” she said, and threw a kiss somewhere
in the air.</p>

<p>There followed days of anxiety when the
men at the mine doubted, and the appraisers
hung fire, and pretended to less than they
knew. In the midst of it, the Inger had
ridden away to the desert and camped for
three days, and had returned to find them
cursing him out and making an estimate
of millions. Riding in after dark to send
the message to his father, still grub-staking
to the north, the Inger for the second
time had seen Lory Moor. She was in the
crowd which he was breasting, outside a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>motion picture house. She was in tawdry
pink, with a flame of rose in her hat, and she
was with Bunchy. His hands were upon
her and he was saying something in her ear
from one corner of his mouth. She was not
listening, the Inger thought as he passed her.
She did not see him, and for this he felt
vaguely thankful&mdash;as if he had come on
her in some shame. A day or two after this
Jem had told him that she was to marry
Bunchy.</p>

<p>To marry Bunchy, the Inger thought as he
lounged in the street outside the Inn on her
wedding night, was the worst that could come
to her. He drifted into a saloon across the
way, one of the meaner places, and on this
night of plenty almost unfrequented. He
sat down at a table in range with the doors
of the Inn, and drank reflectively. That
day that he had had her, what if he had
galloped away with her to the foothills, to
the camp, to the other side of somewhere?
He sat thinking of her, wondering why he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
not dared it, playing at what might have been.</p>

<p>On the table lay a San Francisco newspaper,
three days old. As he drank he glanced at
the headlines. “War May Last Another
Year,” he read. “Reserves of Three Nations
to be Called Out Within the Month.”</p>

<p>The thought had come to him before, since
the money came. To-night he turned to it
in a kind of relief: Why not go there? There
was fighting worth a man’s hand. Drunken
Indians, an outlaw or two, a horse thief strung
up in a wink and all over&mdash;these were all
that he knew of warfare. Was he to die with
no more understanding than this of how a
man might live and die? The thing was
happening now&mdash;the adventure of the great
guns and the many deaths. Yet he, a man
like other men, sat here idle. He closed his
eyes and lay with those men in the trenches,
or leapt up to kill again and again at fifty
yards, saw the men roll in torture, saw them
red and grovelling in red.... A lust of
the thing came on him. He wanted it, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>he wanted no other thing that his mind had
ever played with. He forgot Jem Moor’s
daughter in that imaginary desert. He swallowed
and tasted and opened his eyes as on a
forgotten world. He pounded the table for
more liquor.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go to the war, you scared,
snivelling Pale-liver?” he demanded of the
shuffling bartender.</p>

<p>The small man’s little red-rimmed and red-shot
eyes lighted, and his lips drew back over
black teeth.</p>

<p>“If I was a young dog like you, I’d be there
stickin’ in the lead, you bet,” he said. “What
you ’fraid of?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’,” said the Inger, suddenly; “I’m
goin’!”</p>

<p>“Plough some of ’em up prime for me,”
begged the old man. “I croaked two men
myself afore I was your age. It were in a
sheriff’s raid, though,” he regretfully added.</p>

<p>The Inger looked at him thoughtfully. It
occurred to him that though he was credited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>with it, he himself had never killed a man in
his life. Yet killing was a man’s job, and over
there was the war, and he had the means to
get to it. There was need of more to kill&mdash;and
to be killed. And he had been hanging
on a shelf of Whiteface for all these months!</p>

<p>He drained his glass and went to the door,
as if the need to do something at once were
upon him. He saw that the wedding guests
were filling the streets, and moving into the
Inn. All of Inch was out there&mdash;the women
gorgeous in all that they had, and even some
of the men dressed in the clothes which they
wore on a journey. Already some were
drunken, and all were loud with merriment,
which they somehow felt was required of
them, like eating three times a day or scorning
a stranger. Everywhere there were children,
who must needs go where the grown folk
went or be left alone. “Parents Must Keep
Children Off the Floor,” was posted on the
walls of the Inch public dance halls.</p>

<p>Next to the office door, the door of the hotel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>bar stood open now, and by the array of cut
colored paper hanging from the chandeliers,
he guessed that the wedding was to be solemnized
in there. This was natural&mdash;the bar
was the largest room in the house, and the
most magnificent in the town&mdash;the only bar,
in fact, with a real mirror at the back. Moreover,
Bunchy’s barkeeper was a man of parts,
being a bass singer and a justice of the peace.
With his apron laid aside, he was to give a
tune while the guests assembled, and afterward
it was he who was to perform the ceremony.
Nobody thought of expecting the
ceremony to be held in Jem Moor’s ’dobe.</p>

<p>It was Jem Moor himself who, while the
wedding guests were still noisily passing in the
hotel, the Inger saw coming down the street.
He was neatly dressed in the best he had, and
though one trouser leg had crept to the top
of a boot, and his red cravat was under an ear,
still he bore signs of a sometime careful toilet.
He broke into an uneven run&mdash;the running
of a man whose feet are old and sore&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
disappeared in the doorway of the Inn office.</p>

<p>The Inger’s look followed him, speculatively.</p>

<p>“But one more drink and I could be
over there makin’ more kinds of hell than
usual,” he said to himself, and went back to
the bar.</p>

<p>He was draining his glass when the sound of
confused talk and movement came to him, and,
as he wheeled, he saw that across the street
the interior of the Inn bar and office were in
an uproar. The wedding guests were rising,
there were shouts and groans, and a shrill
scream or two. Some came running to the
street, and over all there burst occasional
great jets of men’s laughter.</p>

<p>“’S up?” asked the old barkeeper behind
him.</p>

<p>The Inger did not answer. He stood in the
doorway waiting for something. He did not
know what he waited for, but the imminent
thing, whatever it was, held him still. A
hope, which he could not have formulated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
came shining slowly toward him, in him.</p>

<p>In a moment, Jem Moor emerged from the
office door, still brokenly running, seeking
to escape from those who crowded with
him, questioning him. The Inger strolled
from the doorway, across the street, took his
way through the little group which fell back
for him, and brought his hand down on the
old man’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Anything wrong?” he inquired.</p>

<p>Jem Moor looked up at him. He was
pinched and the lines of his nose were drawn,
and his lips were pulling.</p>

<p>“She’s skipped,” he said. “I’m in for
’Leven Hundred odd, to Bunchy.”</p>

<p>Something in the Inger leaped out and
soared. He stood there, saying what he
had to say, conscious all the time that as
soon as might be he should be free to soar
with it.</p>

<p>“Alone?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Jem Moor held out a scrap of paper. The
Inger took it and read, the others peering over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
his arms and shoulders.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Dad,” it said, “I can’t go Bunchy.
I know what this’ll do to you, but I
can’t never do it&mdash;I can’t. I’ve
gone for good. Dear old Dad, don’t
you hate me.</p>

<p class="pr2 reduct">“<span class="smcap">Lory.</span>”</p>

<p class="p1">The tears were running down Jem Moor’s
face.</p>

<p>“‘Leven Hundred odd,” said he, “and I
ain’t a red. Not a red.”</p>

<p>The Inger threw up his head.</p>

<p>“Lord Harry,” he cried. “Why didn’t I
think of it before? Buck up!” he cried,
bringing down his hand on Jem’s little
shoulder. “And drink up! Come along in!”</p>

<p>He led the way to the Mission Saloon, and
bade the man take orders for everybody.
Then he went to the back of the place, and
found for himself ink and a pen, and tore a
leaf from a handy account book. When he
had filled in the name of his bank, he wrote
and signed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Pay to Bunchy Haight, Twelve
Hundred Dollars and be damned to
him.”</p>

<p class="p1">Then he wrote out a receipt to Jem Moor,
with a blank for the sum and for Bunchy’s
signature.</p>

<p>When he could, he drew Jem in a corner
and thrust at him the papers. The little
man stared at them, with a peculiarly ugly,
square dropping of his jaw, and eyes pointed
at top.</p>

<p>“Don’t bust,” said the Inger, “and don’t
think it’s you. It ain’t you. The check
isn’t drawn to you, is it? I want to hell-and-devil
Bunchy some, that’s all. Shut up your
mouth!” he added, when Jem tried gaspingly
to thank him.</p>

<p>Then he got out of the place, where sharp
music was beginning and the ten or twelve
women were dancing among the tables, and
went down the street, thronged now with the
disappointed guests, intent on forcing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
ruined evening to some wild festivity. When
they called to him to join them, he hardly
heard. He went straight through the town
and shook it from him and met the desert,
and took his own trail.</p>

<p>The night was now one of soft, thick blackness,
on which the near stars pressed. The
air had a sharp chill&mdash;as if it bore no essence
of its own but hung empty of warmth
when the daylight was drained from it. The
stillness was insistent. In a place of water,
left from the rains, and still deep enough to
run in ripples over the sedge, frogs were in
chorus.</p>

<p>There was a sentinel pepper tree on the
edge of the town and here a mocking-bird
sang out, once, and was still. These left
behind, and the saw and crack and beat of
the music dying, the Inger faced the dark,
gave himself to the exultation which flowed
in him, mounted with it to a new place.</p>

<p>The liquor which he had drunk was in his
veins, and to this the part of him which understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
all the rest of him credited his swimming
delight. But separate from this, as his
breath was separate, there came and went
like a pulse, something else which he could
not possibly have defined, born in him in the
street, when he had heard Jem Moor’s bad
news.</p>

<p>He threw out his arms and ran, staggering.
What was there that he must do? Here he
was, ready for it. What was there that he
must do? Then he remembered. The War!
He would have that. That was what he could
do.</p>

<p>He stood still on the desert, and imagined
himself one of thousands on the plain. What
if he were with them there in the darkness?
What if the rise of the sand were the edge of the
opposite trenches, with men breathing behind
them, waiting? With a drunken laugh, he
pulled his revolver, and fired and shouted.
Why, he could plough his way through anything.
He should not go down&mdash;not he!
But he should be fighting like this in the field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of civilized men, and not taking his adventures
piecemeal, in a back lot of the world, with a
skulking sheriff or two and Bunchy for
adversary. To-morrow! He would go to-morrow,
and find what his life could give him.</p>

<p>But this other thing that was pulsing in
him ... the girl! What about her? Was
he not to find her, was he not to have her?
He closed his eyes and swam in the thought
of her. War and the woman&mdash;suddenly
he was aflame with them both.</p>

<p>When he went into the wood, he went singing.
He himself was the centre of the night
and of his universe. The wood, Whiteface,
his journey, the war, lay ready to his hand
as accessory and secondary to his consciousness.
He felt his own life, and other life
was its background. He made a long crying
guttural noise, like an animal. He
shook his great body and crashed through
the undergrowth, the young saplings stinging
his cheeks. To-morrow&mdash;he would be off
to-morrow....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>He emerged upon the little space which was
his home. The fire had fallen and was a red
glow, and a watching eye. Rolled in his
blanket beside it lay his father, deeply breathing.
In a moment the Inger became another
being. He stood tense, stepped softly, entered
quietly the open door of his hut.</p>

<p>Within something stirred, was silent, stirred
again, with a movement as of garments.
Out of the darkness, her voice came:</p>

<p>“Mr. Inger: ... It’s Lory Moor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">III</h2>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment he thought that this would
be a part of his crazy dreaming, and he said
nothing. But then he knew that she had
risen and was standing before him; and he
heard her breath, taken tremblingly. Her
words came rushing&mdash;almost the first words
that he had ever heard her say:</p>

<p>“You been down there. You know. I
don’t know where to go. Oh&mdash;don’t tell
’em!”</p>

<p>“Tell ’em,” he muttered, stupidly. “Tell
’em?”</p>

<p>“I can’t do it,” she said gaspingly. “I
can’t&mdash;I can’t.”</p>

<p>She was sobbing, and the Inger, so lately
a flame of intent and desire, did not dare to
touch her, and had no least idea what to say
to her. In a moment she was able to speak
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought I could hide here for a day or
two,” she said, “till they quit huntin’. Then
I could get away. Would you hide me, somehow?&mdash;would
you?”</p>

<p>He was silent, trying to think, with a head
not too clear, how best to do it; and she
misunderstood.</p>

<p>“Don’t make me go back&mdash;don’t tell Dad
and Bunchy! If you can’t hide me, I’ll go
now,” she said.</p>

<p>“What you talkin’?” he said, roughly.
“I’m thinkin’. Thinkin’ up how. Thinkin’
up how.” He put his hands to his temples.
“My head don’t think,” he said thickly.</p>

<p>“Here in the hut,” she said, eagerly and
clearly. “They’ll never think of comin’ up
here. Why, I don’t hardly know you.”</p>

<p>“Won’t they though?” said the Inger, suddenly,
and dimly remembered Bunchy, and
the blow for the sake of the girl. Last,
there came dancing to him something about
a check for the debt to Bunchy which she had
not paid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“As it happens,” said the Inger, “this is
jus’ the first place where they will come
lookin’ for you. Jus’ the first place....”</p>

<p>“Why?” she cried.</p>

<p>“Nev’ you mind,” he said.</p>

<p>He could almost see her, standing within
his door, her white face blooming from the
black. But his sense of her was obscured to
him by the need for immediate action, and
by his utter present inability to cope with that
need.</p>

<p>“How’d you come&mdash;to come&mdash;to come
up here?” he asked curiously.</p>

<p>For a breath she hesitated, and there was a
soft taking of breath in her answer.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know no woman I could tell,”
she said, “nor no other decent man.”</p>

<p>From head to foot a fire went over the
Inger, such as he had never known. And
first he was weak with her words, and then
he was jubilantly strong. He put them away,
but they lay within him burning, where again
and again he could turn to them for warmth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“How&mdash;how’d you hit the trail up?” he
asked almost gently.</p>

<p>Again she was silent for a moment, and her
answer was very low.</p>

<p>“I’d been by here once-to-twice before,”
she said.</p>

<p>Hazily he turned this over. The trail led
only to his hut. No one ever came who had
not come to be there. Unless&mdash;</p>

<p>He threw back his head as something new
swam to consciousness. She stood quietly,
waiting to hear what he would do. Some
sense of this sudden new dependence on him
beset him like words.</p>

<p>“They’s a way over the mountain,” he
muttered. “I made it in that sheriff business.
Can you take that?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go any way,” she said.</p>

<p>“It’s pretty rough,” he told her. “It’s
pretty rough,” he repeated with intense care.
“I’ll take you. I’ll take you,” he insisted
thickly.</p>

<p>“You mean you’d go with me?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’d never fin’ it if I didn’t,” he told her.
“Y-you’d never fin’ it. Never.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go any way,” she repeated. “But I
didn’t mean to&mdash;to come down on to you like
that.”</p>

<p>“Tha’s nothing,” he said. “Tha’s nothing.
Tha’s nothing.”</p>

<p>He put his hand to his head, with the need to
touch it and to make it work properly. He
had to think of things to do, and how could
he do that? His father, for example&mdash;what
should he do about him? He went a few
steps without the door, and tried to consider,
looking at the sleeping figure by the fire.
The faint glow of the coals made a little ring
of dim light. In it he stood, swaying.</p>

<p>“Oh my God,” she said, behind him. “You
are drunk.”</p>

<p>“Li’l bit,” he admitted. “Li’l bit. Not
enough to scare a b-baby.”</p>

<p>She put this away scornfully. “Scare
nothin’,” she said sharply. “Can you keep
to the trail? That’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>He laughed foolishly. “Tha’s all right,”
he repeated, “I can find trail, drunk or
sober.”</p>

<p>She stood pressing her hands in and out and
turning helplessly to the dark. The dark
gave her back only the lights of Inch.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing else to do,” she said dully.
“If you show me the trail, maybe I can keep
you on it.”</p>

<p>In some indeterminate shame, he went
without a word, brought his blanket, and
turned again to the hut.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a kit,” she said. “It’s got enough
to eat. Do you understand? Don’t get
anything else. Oh, let’s start, let’s start!”</p>

<p>As he emerged, his hand had brushed the
feathers of the wood duck. He took it down
and slung it fumblingly to his roll of blanket.
Less by taking thought than by old instinct,
he remembered his cartridge belt, and found
and strapped it on. Then he stood hesitating.</p>

<p>“Gotta tell ’em,” he suggested, looking at
his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>She had shouldered her pack and stood
waiting.</p>

<p>“Why?” she demanded. “It’ll only be
harder for him if they come. This way he
won’t know, and he can tell ’em so.”</p>

<p>In this there was reason, but not, it seemed,
enough reason. The Inger stood trying to
recall something pressing on him for remembrance:
if not his father, what was it that
he must do or fetch, before he left. He put
both hands to his head, but in there was only
a current and a beating.</p>

<p>“There’s s’more to do,” he said indistinctly.</p>

<p>Lory Moor stepped toward him and laid
her hand briskly on his shoulder, with a boy’s
gesture of eager haste.</p>

<p>“The trail&mdash;the trail!” she said, with
authority. “Find us the trail.”</p>

<p>Without a word he started, went round the
end of the hut, and plunged into the wood,
which ran down to the very wall. In a half
dozen steps the ascent began.</p>

<p>Even by daylight the trail was little more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
than an irregular line of bent branches and
blazed trunks. Since he had finished it, the
Inger had taken it a dozen times by daylight
with a boy’s delight in a secret way. By
night he had never taken it at all. But he
had the woodsman’s instinct and, now that
his thoughts were stilled or lost in a maze of
their own inconsequent making, this secondary
consciousness was for a time paramount.
He went as a man goes who treads his own
ways, and though he went irregularly and
sometimes staggeringly, he managed at first
to keep to the course that he had taken.</p>

<p>Over the mountain by the trail to the railway
station&mdash;that had become clear to him.
When they should reach it or how the railway
should serve, was not his concern at all.
Meanwhile, here she was with him. He tried
to get this straight, and cursed his head that
only buzzed with the knowledge and whipped
him with the need to keep to the trail.</p>

<p>“Lory Moor,” he tried to grasp it; “Jem
Moor’s girl. She never married Bunchy at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
all. She’s here&mdash;<i>with me</i>. I’ve got her
with me....”</p>

<p>The girl was not a pace behind him. She
had stretched out her hand and laid it on his
roll of blanket and thus, though seeing nothing,
she was able to fit her steps somewhat to his,
to halt when he halted, to swerve or to slow
or to retrace. She was profoundly thankful
for his consent to take her away, and in that
consent she rested without thought or plan.</p>

<p>An hour passed before the Inger missed the
trail. In a stretch fairly free of undergrowth,
he stood still for a moment to take his bearings,
and thrust out his hand against a declivity,
sharp with fallen rock. To the right the
wall extended to meet the abrupt shoulder of
the slope; to the left it dropped away so that a
stone, sent down, went crashing far below.</p>

<p>“Stay here,” the Inger commanded, and
found his way up in a shower of falling rocks,
to the summit of the obstruction. He clung
to a tree, and listened. The mountain brook,
which they should cross some rods ahead, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
not yet audible. On the other side the rocks
fell precipitately; and leaning out, he
seemed to sense tree-tops.</p>

<p>“Look out!” he called, and clambered
down again, and bade her wait while he went
and came back and went and came back in
vain. She heard him stumbling, no more fit
to find a trail than to think his thoughts.</p>

<p>“I’m stumped,” he said. “We’ve got
wrong somewheres.”</p>

<p>She answered nothing. She was sitting
on the ground where he had left her. Her
silence touched him somehow as a rebuke.
“You think it’s because I’m drunk,” he
said, in a challenge.</p>

<p>“I don’t think anything,” she answered.
“Rest a little&mdash;then mebbe we can get
right again.”</p>

<p>He flung himself down on his face. The
scent of pine needles and dead leaves was
there, waiting for him. The stillness of the
wood took them both, and for a few minutes
they were silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>And as he lay there, with her sitting beside
him, something of the desert, of an hour
before, came running along his veins and took
him, and, something, too, of the time when he
had had her before him on his horse, galloping.
When that time had been he could not say;
but he remembered it with distinctness, and
that day he had had his arms about her.</p>

<p>“We rode&mdash;on a horse,” he submitted,
suddenly. “C’n you ’member that day?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered. “Don’t talk,” she
begged him, “just rest. I want to rest.”</p>

<p>The Inger was silent. His mind was busy
trying to piece together what he knew of
that day&mdash;of her there before him on his
horse, of her face laughing at him as she
ran away.</p>

<p>“You threw me a kiss,” he offered, after a
pause.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk, don’t talk,” she begged him.
“I can’t breathe&mdash;let me rest.”</p>

<p>“I wish it was that day now,” he said
foolishly, and drew a deep breath, and lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
quiet. But in a few minutes he roused himself,
his mind struggling with a new problem.
What a fool he was, wishing for that day,
when here she was, just the same as then.
What was the matter with this day?</p>

<p>“Wha’s the matter with this day?” he
inquired, reasonably. Then he remembered.
They were lost, of course. The trail was
gone&mdash;gone clean off.</p>

<p>“Gone clean off,” he muttered, reproachfully.
“Damn dirty trick to play.”</p>

<p>Then he was shot through with his dominant
consciousness. Here she was, here she
was&mdash;with him. There was something else,
something that she had said which made a
reason why he should not touch her. But
what was that? It was gone&mdash;gone clean
off, gone with the trail....</p>

<p>Back upon him came flooding the desire of
the desert, as he had run with the thought of
her and with the thought of battle. Then
he had believed that she belonged to Bunchy.
That was a lie and Bunchy was a fool. Everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
was different, and now here she was and
nobody knew....</p>

<p>He lifted himself, and scrambled forward
toward her.</p>

<p>“We’re lost,” he said thickly. “Wha’d
we care? Wha’d we care....”</p>

<p>He put out his arms, but they did not touch
her. He swept a circle, and they did not
enclose her. Alarmed, he rose and lurched
forward, feeling out in all directions, an arm’s
span. And she was not within his reach nor
within the crazy length which he ran, with
outspread hands, trying to find her.</p>

<p>At last his foot caught in a root and he fell,
and lay there, and began quietly weeping.
Now she was gone and the trail was gone.
He was treated like a dog by both of them.
He fumbled for his pack, but he had slipped
that off when he climbed the rocks, and now
that was gone too. He wept, and lay still.
In a few moments he was sleeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">IV</h2>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">When</span> he awoke, he looked into soft branches,
gray in dim light. The whole mountain was
lyric with birds. There was no other sound,
save the lift and touch of branches, and the
chatter of a squirrel, and there was as yet no
sun.</p>

<p>He remembered. And with the memory,
a rush of aching, eating shame seized on him
and he closed his eyes again. Then he
thought that he must have dreamed it all.
And that it was impossible that such a thing
should be. Yet here he was in the woods,
where she had left him because he was a
fool. Where had she gone? He sprang up,
mad to find her, possessed by the need to
make amends, and by the sheer need to find
her.</p>

<p>As he sat up, he threw off his blanket, and
he marvelled that this should have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
covering him. Then he found himself looking
into Lory Moor’s face.</p>

<p>She was sitting near him, wrapped in her
own blanket, leaning against a tree. She
was wide awake, and by all signs she had
been so for a long time, for a great cluster of
mountain violets lay on her blanket.</p>

<p>When she saw that he was awake, she
smiled, and this seemed to the Inger the
most marvellous thing that ever had befallen
him: that she was there and that she
smiled.</p>

<p>He looked at her silently, and slowly under
the even brownness of his skin, the color rose
from his throat to his forehead, and burned
crimson. But more than this color of shame,
it was his eyes that told. They were upon
her, brown, deep, like the eyes of a dog that
has disobeyed, and has come back. For a
moment he looked at her, then he dropped
his face in his hands.</p>

<p>She moved so quietly that he did not hear
her rise. He merely felt her hand on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
shoulder. And when he looked up again,
she was sitting there beside him.</p>

<p>“Don’t,” she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her in amazement. Her look
was gentle, her voice had been gentle.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t,” she said. “It’s all over
now.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of me? What do
you think of me?” he muttered, stupidly.</p>

<p>She shrugged lightly. “It don’t make any
difference what I think of you,” she said.
“Ain’t it whether I’m goin’ to get away from
Inch or not? Ain’t that the idea?”</p>

<p>When he came to think of it, that was the
immediate concern. With his first utterance
he had blundered, as he had blundered since
the moment when she had put herself in his
keeping. None the less his misery was too
sharp to dismiss. But he had no clear idea
how to ask a woman’s forgiveness&mdash;a thing
that he had never done in his life.</p>

<p>“I feel as bad as hell,” he blurted out.</p>

<p>“What for?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“For all I’ve done,” he put it.</p>

<p>She considered this.</p>

<p>“Look here,” she said slowly. “You’ve
been drunk before often enough, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, miserably.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t feel bad about this just
because I mixed up in it,” she said. “I’m
used to it. I see Dad and all of ’em drunk
more times ’n I see ’em sober.”</p>

<p>He looked away from her.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t thinking just about being drunk,”
he said. “I meant&mdash;what I said to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;that!” she said. “Well. All men
say that, I guess.” She looked at him. “I
did guess you was differ’nt, but I ought to
knowed better.”</p>

<p>Then in a flash of intense joy, he remembered
what she had said to him in the hut.
Her words came back as if she were speaking
them again: “I didn’t know no woman I
could tell. Nor no other decent man.” Once
more the warmth of this was upon him,
within him. Then the recollection of how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
he had failed her invaded him in an anguish
new, impossible to combat. For she had
thought that he was different from Jem
Moor and Bunchy....</p>

<p>The Inger got to his feet.</p>

<p>“I <i>am</i> differ’nt,” he heard himself surprisingly
saying.</p>

<p>She regarded him curiously, and with
nothing in her eyes. It came to him as he
stood looking down at her, that he would
give all that might be asked if he could have
seen her eyes as she looked up at him in the
hut the night before and told him why she
had come to him to help her. In the face of
what had happened, the foolishness of protesting
that he was different overcame him,
and he fell silent.</p>

<p>A new anxiety beset him.</p>

<p>“Did you sleep?” he asked her.</p>

<p>She shook her head. “I was afraid,” she
answered, simply.</p>

<p>The Inger stood for a moment as if the
strength had run from his body. She had sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
there, afraid, while he had slept&mdash;and he
himself had been a part of her fear....</p>

<p>He turned away, and across the tops of
the trees, he looked over the valley, still
lying in the shadow. There was mist, and
down there the pointed tops of the trees
showed like green buds fastened to soft
wool. Where they two were, the sun was
already smiting the branches, and silencing
the birds. Overhead, the clear blue, touched
by sunny clouds, lay very near. It was as
if he were trying to find, among them, something
that could help him to tell her what he
was feeling. But he found nothing and he
said nothing. He caught up the blanket
and flung it savagely aside, seized a great
dead limb lying beside him and broke it
over his knee.</p>

<p>“Get out the stuff,” he bade her. “We’ll
have a fire.”</p>

<p>He built and lighted the fire, brought the
water, and found his way down to the
brook. He threw off his clothes, and lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
flat in the bed of the stream, his head on a
rock. The sharp stones cut his flesh, and
the water somehow helped to heal him.
He shook himself, dried by a run down the
trail, dressed, and returned, glowing.</p>

<p>The coffee was on the fire, and she was
making toast on a stick. She had spread
what food she had brought, chiefly fruit and
cooked meat and cheese.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I bring any grub?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“The bird,” she answered. “The big
bird.”</p>

<p>“That’s for dinner,” he observed, gruffly,
and said no more.</p>

<p>He took the stick from her and made the
toast. When she poured the coffee, it was
clear and golden and fragrant. She had
two plates and two cups, the Inger noticed.
She made him roll the blankets for seats. In
spite of his suffering&mdash;which was the more
real that it was new to him&mdash;the cheer and
the invitation of the time warmed him. But
as for her loveliness, he found himself now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
hardly looking at that, save when he must,
as if what she was had become to him something
utterly forbidden.</p>

<p>As for her, while she ate, she continually
listened, and if a twig broke, she started.
For this she laughed at herself once.</p>

<p>“But if he should come,” she said, “if he
should come....”</p>

<p>The Inger looked at her, that once, steadfastly.</p>

<p>“If he should come,” he said, “I could save
you&mdash;now.”</p>

<p>The elusive trail which had baffled him, led
with perfect distinctness along a little shelf
three steps up and around that sharp height
of rocks which he had scaled, and then the
trail dipped down into a narrow cañon, and
up. Before the sun was an hour high, they
were on their way again.</p>

<p>With their brisk progress, her spirits rose,
and once, to the Inger’s exquisite delight,
she broke into a lilt of song.</p>

<p>“You sing the way you laugh,” he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
awkwardly. And she flashed him a smile,
over shoulder, as she had done that morning
on the desert.</p>

<p>A tanager drew a line of scarlet through the
trees, and burned from a bough before them.
In an instant the Inger’s hand was raised,
and he had aimed. But in that second, his
arm was struck aside, the shot glanced
harmlessly among the trees, and the bird
flashed safe to the thicket.</p>

<p>He looked round at her in open amazement.</p>

<p>“What did y’ do that for?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“What did you want to go and kill him
for?” she cried.</p>

<p>He considered this: what <i>had</i> he wanted to
kill that red bird for?</p>

<p>“He was such a pretty little fellow,” she
said, but instead of a rebuke, this seemed to
him a reason.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he seized it eagerly. “That’s why.
You want to get up close to ’em.”</p>

<p>“But if they’re dead....” she protested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“You want to get up nearer to ’em,” he
repeated. “Don’t you see? It’s the only
way you can.”</p>

<p>She said nothing. She was walking before
him now, and he watched her. She had
braided her hair, and he liked the way the
bright braids moved on her shoulders when she
walked, and hung against the hollow of her
waist. She must have braided her hair, he
reflected, before he woke. Then he remembered
the blanket which he had found folded
across his shoulders. She must have found
it, unstrapped it, covered him as he lay. He
longed to let her know that he knew, but he
could not bring himself to recall the time.
“She seems to do everything so careful,” he
thought, and remembered the red bird and
tried to fathom her care for that. When she
stooped to pick up a shining stone, he laughed
out.</p>

<p>“See!” he said. “You want to pick up
that stone to see it. Well, I wanted to kill
the bird&mdash;to see it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“But the bird was alive!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>He stared at her.</p>

<p>“What of it?” said he. “Look at the lots
of ’em there are!”</p>

<p>She said nothing.</p>

<p>“Who’d miss it?” he argued. “Who wants
it? You always kill things.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said vaguely. “I
don’t know why. But it don’t seem right.”</p>

<p>Women were like that, he reflected. They
hated blood. But&mdash;a bird! It was unfathomable.</p>

<p>High noon found them on the summit of
Whiteface, looking down upon the crouching
shoulders of the east foothills. Where they
stood, the sun beat hotly, and the bare rocks
and the coarse growth lay in intense brooding
quiet. Everything there was flat, as if the
long pressure of the sun had told, like weight.</p>

<p>Electrically, the Inger’s spirits returned to
him. Here on the height, kindling fire, boiling
water, spreading food, were no such business
as these had been to him down on his little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
shelf. Here everything had a way of being
that was hitherto unknown to him. When
their table was spread in the shade of a pine,
and the wood duck roasted slowly over the
fire on a spit which he had fashioned, he stood
up and surveyed their work, and his look fell
on the girl, sitting relaxed, with loosely fallen
hands, the sun striking her hair to brightness.</p>

<p>For a moment he let himself watch her,
and catching his look, she smiled, as she had
smiled when his eyes had met hers as he woke.</p>

<p>“Yi&mdash;eh! Yi&mdash;eh! Yi&mdash;e&mdash;h!” he suddenly
shouted with the strength of his lungs.</p>

<p>The echo rolled back to them like a taunt.</p>

<p>She sprang up.</p>

<p>“If they’re huntin’ us&mdash;” she said, trembling,
“oh, they’ll hear that!”</p>

<p>He looked at her in horror. Fool! Would
he never have done with his blundering....</p>

<p>“Oh, my God, I forgot,” he exclaimed, contritely,
and dropped to the ground. “I don’t
get <i>rested</i> between kicking myself for being a
damn fool,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>While they ate, he was quiet. There was
no way to let her know how much he hated
himself, and his thought was occupied with
nothing else. And it was as if she divined,
for she became very gentle.</p>

<p>“I guess maybe you wanted to do somethin’
else to-day,” she said.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“It’s awful, me makin’ you do this,” she
added. “Don’t you think I don’t know that.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t doin’ anything&mdash;what am I
doin’?” he burst out.</p>

<p>She looked at him gravely.</p>

<p>“You’re takin’ me out of a good sight
worse’n death,” she answered. “And don’t
you think I’ll ever forget it.”</p>

<p>There was about her manner of saying this
something infinitely alluring. She fell in a
sudden breathlessness, and her voice had a
tremor which seemed to lie in the very words
themselves. And with this, and with what
she said, the Inger found himself suddenly
utterly unable to deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, g’on,” he said, feebly.</p>

<p>She said no more, and for a moment he was
wretched again lest he had offended her.
But the gentleness and softness of her manner
reassured him. Moreover, he became conscious
that of the cheese and bread she was
leaving the greater part for him, and pretending
to have finished.</p>

<p>After their lunch, a consuming content fell
upon the man, and he lay stretched on his
back, under the pine, staring upward, thinking
of nothing. For a little she moved about, and
then she came and sat beside him, saying nothing.
More than he knew, this power of hers
for silence conquered him. When a man knows
how to live alone, he may or may not understand
words, but he always understands silence.</p>

<p>Presently he looked over at her, and seeing
that her eyes were heavy, he sat erect, with
the memory of her night’s vigil.</p>

<p>“Could you go to sleep?” he demanded.</p>

<p>She nodded. “I <i>could</i>,” she said. “I
guess there ain’t the time,” she added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, there is,” he said eagerly. “We can
get down from here in no time. You rest
yourself.”</p>

<p>She regarded him for a moment. Then,
without a word, she drew her blanket toward
her, rested her head upon it, and relaxed like
a child. In a moment she lay sleeping.</p>

<p>Then he looked at her. All that day he
had averted his eyes, in his shame. But now
that there could be in her look no rebuke, no
reminiscence of the night, he looked at her as
freely as he had looked that day on the desert,
when she had sat his horse before him. Only
then his look had been a flame, and now it
was as if the sight of her was to him a healing
power. For she still trusted him. She was
lying here asleep, and she had set him to
watch. Immeasurably, she was giving him
back his self-respect, restoring to him his own
place in her eyes and in his own. He had
no knowledge that this bore so strong a part
in the creeping sweetness which possessed
him. He only knew that he was happy, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
he dreaded the time when she should awaken
almost as much as he longed for it; and he
hoped with childish intensity that the afternoon
would never end.</p>

<p>That was an hour such as the man had never
known. Women had followed him, tempted
him, run from him, but never in his life had a
woman either begged his help, as one being
of another, or walked with him, comradely.
And with women he had always moved as
lord and dispenser, avoiding them, taking
them for granted, occasionally pursuing them,
but always as chief actor. Now, suddenly,
he had become in his own sight, infinitely
the lesser of the two; and even that grateful
return of belief in himself was a thing which
she was, so gently, bestowing. He sat, sunk
in the newness of what had come upon him,
making no effort to understand, and looking
neither forward nor back. He was beset
alike by the knowledge that she trusted him,
and by the soft movement of her breathing
and by the flushed ripeness of her, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the fact that, at any second, she might waken
and then smile upon him.</p>

<p>When, toward four o’clock, she did waken,
her smile, that was as instant as at a child’s
awakening, was straightway darkened by a
cloud of fear.</p>

<p>“It’s late,” she said. “The train&mdash;can
we get it now?”</p>

<p>“Can we get it now....” The Inger
paused to taste this before he answered.</p>

<p>“Easy,” he said. “You mean the eight:
fifteen for Barstow?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “The eight: fifteen.”
She had not meant for Barstow, but that, as
the farthest eastern destination of those who
usually took train from Inch, was the limit
of the Inger’s imagining.</p>

<p>“Easy,” he repeated.</p>

<p>The way of descent, in the slanting light,
was incredibly lovely. The time had assumed
another air. With that low sun,
everything was thrown sharply against the sky,
like a pattern on a background. Something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of the magic of the Northern days lay upon
that Southern land.</p>

<p>Once, feeling suddenly articulate, the Inger
looked over his shoulder at her, as she followed.</p>

<p>“It’s hell, ain’t it?” he said admiringly.</p>

<p>She understood this as the extreme of
expression, anywhere applied.</p>

<p>“Ain’t it?” she agreed fervently.</p>

<p>It was not yet seven o’clock when they
emerged from the last cañon, and tramped
across the sage brush toward the town.
There the lights were slowly shining out, and
all the tawdry, squalid play of the night was
beginning, as night after night it begins in
the ugly settlements where men herd on the
Great Desert under solemn skies. As the
first sound of rattling music came to the man
and the woman, she turned to him.</p>

<p>“Is big towns like little ones, do you
know?” she asked.</p>

<p>He reflected, remembered San Francisco,
and replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “I s’pose so, mostly. But
the parts where the folks try to be nice,” he
added, vindictively, “are worse’n this and
Inch.”</p>

<p>“Why?” she demanded, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Because,” he said, “they get too nice.
They’re slush nice,” he explained it.</p>

<p>She mulled this.</p>

<p>“I saw a lady, once,” she said. “She got
off at Inch to mail a letter. Her hair was
combed pretty and she had her gloves on and
her shoes fit her feet&mdash;I donno. She must
of come from somewheres,” she added vaguely.</p>

<p>He was silent and she tried to be clear.</p>

<p>“She wasn’t good-dressed like Beautiful
Kate and them,” she added anxiously. “She
spoke nice, too. I heard her get a stamp
from Leadpipe Pete. Her words come so&mdash;easy.”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“There are them,” he said from his experience.
“But not many.”</p>

<p>As they approached the station some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
stragglers were gathering to wait for the
train, and the two remained near the far end
of the platform. A monotonously repeated
command forced itself to their attention.
On a stretch of bare, hard-trodden sand, a
company of the town guard was drilling in the
twilight. About forty slim, loose-jointed
youths were advancing and wheeling under
the direction of a stocky, middle-aged man
who walked like a rooster and shouted indistinguishably,
in the evident belief that the
tone was the thing. The Inger walked to
the edge of the platform, and stared at them.</p>

<p>“That’s the United States Army,” he said,
not without reverence.</p>

<p>She made no comment, and they watched
the whole line in columns of four, advancing
in double time. The rhythmic motion of the
khaki legs vaguely touched the Inger with
sensuous pleasure.</p>

<p>“Ain’t it grand?” he said.</p>

<p>“Grand!” repeated the girl. “It’s the
limit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he asked, looking
round at her.</p>

<p>“When they march,” she said, “I always
think: ‘Dead legs, dead legs, dead legs.’
I hate ’em.”</p>

<p>He smiled tolerantly.</p>

<p>“Women are lame ducks on the war
game,” he admitted. “Look-a-here,” he
added. “I might as well tell you: I’m goin’
to Europe to get into the fight.”</p>

<p>“On purpose?” she asked, incredulously.</p>

<p>He nodded. “It’s the only man’s job on
the place just now,” he told her. “Everybody
else is just hangin’ round, lookin’ on. I want
to be in on it.”</p>

<p>She stood very still, and in the half light
her face seemed white and suddenly tired.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask which side?” he
prompted her.</p>

<p>“I don’t care which side,” she answered, and
walked back toward the end of the platform.</p>

<p>He kept beside her, curiously beset by the
need to follow his spectacular announcement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
with some explanation. And abruptly he
thought that he understood her attitude.</p>

<p>“I s’pose,” he said, shamefacedly, “you’re
thinkin’ I won’t be much of a soldier if I
behave as I did last night.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” she said, “I don’t see as it
matters much whether they’re shot drunk or
shot sober.”</p>

<p>While he was groping at this, she added:</p>

<p>“I donno but they’re better off drunk&mdash;they
can’t kill so many o’ the others.”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand&mdash;” he began, but
she cut him short curtly.</p>

<p>“I better get my ticket,” she said.</p>

<p>“I’ll get it,” he told her. “Barstow&mdash;ain’t
it?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not going to Barstow,” she
answered. “Get it to Lamy.”</p>

<p>He faced her in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Lamy!” he cried. “Murderation. <i>Clear</i>
east?”</p>

<p>“I’ve counted up,” she explained. “That’s
as far as I’ve got the money to get. I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
stay there till I earn some to go on with. I’ve
got an aunt in Chicago.”</p>

<p>“East!” he said weakly. “Why, I never
thought o’ you goin’ East.”</p>

<p>The station platform led with that amazing
informality of the western American railway
station, to the raw elemental sand of the
desert. Within sight of the electric lamps
of the station, were the tall flowers of the
Yucca and the leaves of the Spanish bayonet
and the flare of the spineless cactus under
uninterrupted areas of dusky sky, stretched
as sand and sky had stretched for countless
ages. Of the faint tread of the soldiers, the
commands of the captain, the trundle of a
truck, the click of the telegraph instrument,
those sands and those stars were as unconscious
as they had been in the beginning.
And abruptly, as he looked at these lifelong
friends of his, the Inger felt intolerably
alone.</p>

<p>“What do you want to go East for?” he
demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Chicago’s the only place I’ve got anybody
I could go to,” she said. “But that ain’t
the reason,” she added. “I want to get as
far as I can, ’count of Bunchy.”</p>

<p>She looked back at the group gathering at
the station to see the train come in.</p>

<p>“You better get the ticket just to Albuquerque,”
she said. “Somebody might try
to follow me up.”</p>

<p>“Albuquerque nothing,” he said roughly.
“I’ll buy you your ticket right through&mdash;to
Chicago.” He went toward her. “Don’t go&mdash;don’t
go!” he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him, intently, as if she were
trying to fathom what he would have said.
But in that intentness of her look, he saw
only her memory of the night before. He
drew sharply back, and turned away. “I
hate for you to go ’way off there alone,” he
mumbled.</p>

<p>Across the desert, clear against the dusk of
the mountains, a red eye came toward them.
She saw it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh quick,” she said. “There’s the train.
Get it just to Albuquerque. I’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>She gave him a knotted handkerchief, and
he took it and ran down the platform. This
handkerchief he could give back to her as
she was leaving, and he would of course buy
the ticket through&mdash;</p>

<p>He stopped short on the platform.</p>

<p>“What with, you fool?” he thought.</p>

<p>He remembered his drunken impression of
the night before that there was, before he
should leave, something more to do, or to fetch.
His hand went to his pocket. Half a dozen
silver dollars were there, no more. In his
wallet, which he searched under the light,
were two five dollar bills. By now he could
hear the rumble of the Overland.</p>

<p>Outside the station two or three Mexicans
were lounging. Half a dozen renegade Indians
were faithfully arriving with their bead
chains and baskets. The waiting-room was
empty.</p>

<p>The Inger went in the waiting-room and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
closed the door. The ticket agent stood behind
his window, counting that which ticket-agents
perpetually count. The Inger thrust
his own head and shoulders through the
window, and with them went his revolver.</p>

<p>“I’m Inger of Inch,” he said. “I guess
you know me, don’t you? Just you give me a
through ticket and all the trimmings to Chicago,
till I can get to a bank, or I’ll blow all your
brains out of you. Can you understand?”</p>

<p>The ticket agent glanced up, looked into
the muzzle, and went on quietly counting.</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Inger,” he said. “I guess
the Flag-pole can stand that much. But you
hadn’t ought to be so devilish lordly in your
ways,” he complained.</p>

<p>The Inger pocketed his revolver, and smiled&mdash;the
slow, indolent, adorable smile which had
made all Inch and the men at the mines his
friends.</p>

<p>“If you feel that way about it, my
friend&mdash;” he said, and leaned forward and
added something, his hand outstretched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The man nodded, shook the hand, and went
to his ticket rack. The Inger wrote out a
message to his father, instructing him to pay
to the agent a sum which he named; and to
his bank he scribbled and posted a brief note.
Then as the train pulled in, he turned back
to where Lory waited.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he told her. “Everything’s
all right,” he added jubilantly. “Come on!”</p>

<p>Beside the train she would have taken his
hand, but he followed her. “I’m coming in,”
he said brusquely, and in the coach sat down
beside her in her seat.</p>

<p>Then she turned to him, and in her
voice were the tremor and the breathlessness
which had been there for an instant when,
in the morning, she had tried to say her
thanks:</p>

<p>“I wish’t I could thank you,” she said. “I
wish’t I could!”</p>

<p>He met her eyes, and he longed inexpressibly
for a way of speech which should say the
thing that he meant to try to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“You know, don’t you,” he asked awkwardly,
“that I’d do anything to make up&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” she begged. “I know. Don’t
you think I don’t know.”</p>

<p>With this his courage mounted.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he burst out. “Will you tell
me? Am I different&mdash;ain’t I different&mdash;from
the way you thought?”</p>

<p>It was blind enough, but she seemed to
understand.</p>

<p>“You’ve treated me whiter to-day than I’ve
ever been treated,” she said, very low. “Now
good-bye!”</p>

<p>The Inger sat silent, but in his face came
light, as if back upon him were that which
she had kindled there in the hut, by her trust
in him, and as if it were not again to darken.
The train began to move, and he sat there
and did not heed it.</p>

<p>“Good-bye&mdash;oh, good-bye!” she said.
“We’re going!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “we’re going! I donno
what you’ll say&mdash;I got me a ticket too.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">V</h2>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">It</span> was black dawn when Lory and the Inger
reached Chicago. Not the gray dawn that
he had sometimes known slipping down the
sides of the cañons; not the red dawn that
had drawn him to his hut door to face upward
to the flaming sky, and had sent him naked
and joyous, into the pool of the mountain
stream; and not the occasional white dawn,
which had left him silent on his shelf of Whiteface,
staring at the flare of silver in the east,
and afterward letting fall into his skillet
bacon and dripping&mdash;but without thinking
of bacon and dripping at all.</p>

<p>There in the railway sheds this Chicago
dawn had no red, no white, no gray. It was
merely a thinning of the dark, so that the
station lamps began to be unnecessary. In
this strange chill air of day, the men and
women dropped from the Overland, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
streamed steadfastly away, each in an incredible
faith of destination. And from invisible sources
there came those creeping gases which are slaves
to man, but fasten upon his throat like hands,
and press and twist, and take their toll of him.</p>

<p>Lory looked up at the Inger questioningly:</p>

<p>“Had it ought to be like this,” she asked,
“or is something happening?”</p>

<p>“Seems as if something must be happening,”
he answered.</p>

<p>They went into the street, and the Inger
took from her the slip of paper on which was
written her aunt’s address. He held it out
to the first man he saw, to the second, to the
third, and each one answered him with much
pointing, in a broken tongue which was indistinguishable,
and hurried on. Lory looked
at the stream of absorbed, leaden faces of
those tramping to their work, heard their
speech as they passed, and turned a startled
face to the Inger:</p>

<p>“I never thought of it,” she said. “Mebbe
they don’t talk American, East?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“They won’t stop for us,” said the Inger.
“That’s all.”</p>

<p>From one or two others they caught “South,”
“Kedzie,” “Indiana Avenue.” Some frankly
shook their heads with “From th’ old country.”
No officer was in sight, and it occurred
to neither of them to look for one. They
merely instinctively threw themselves on the
stream of those others whom they took to be
like themselves.</p>

<p>Abruptly the Inger set down his pack in the
middle of the walk, and advanced upon the
first man whom he saw. On both shoulders
of this one he brought down his hands with
the grasp of a Titan. Also he shook him
slightly:</p>

<p>“You tell me how to get to where I’m goin’
or I’ll lamm the lights out of you!” he roared.</p>

<p>The man&mdash;a young timekeeper whose
work took him out earlier, so to speak, than
his station&mdash;regarded the Inger in alarm.</p>

<p>“Lord Heavens,” the young timekeeper
said, “how do I know where you’re goin’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Still grasping him with one hand, the Inger
opened the other and shook Lory’s paper in
the man’s face.</p>

<p>“That’s where,” he said. “Now do you
know?”</p>

<p>The man looked right and left and took the
paper, on which the Inger’s fingers did not
loosen.</p>

<p>“Well, get on an Indiana Avenue car and
transfer,” he said. “Anybody could tell you
that.”</p>

<p>“Where?” yelled the Inger. “Where is
that car?”</p>

<p>A crowd was gathering, and the clerk inclined
to jest by way of discounting that
disconcerting clutch on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Depends on which one you catch&mdash;” he
was beginning, but the Inger, with his one
hand, shook him deliberately and mightily:</p>

<p>“Where?” he said. “And none of your
lip about north or south! Point your finger.
<i>Where?</i>”</p>

<p>It was at that minute that the young timekeeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
caught sight of Lory. She had pressed
forward, and she stood with the Inger’s pack
on the ground at her feet, and her own on her
shoulder. She was, of course, still hatless,
but she had knotted upon her head a scarlet
handkerchief; and in that dull air, her hair
and face, under their cap of color, bloomed
exquisitely. The man, having stared at her
for a moment, and at that strange luggage
of theirs, took out his watch:</p>

<p>“Come along,” he said curtly. “I’ll put
you on your car.”</p>

<p>The Inger searched his face. “No tricks?”
he demanded. Then, swiftly, he released his
hold. “Obliged to ye,” he said, and picked
up his pack and followed.</p>

<p>They slipped on the black stones, breasted
the mass waiting to board the same car, and
somehow found a foothold. Already there
was no seat. The patient crowd herded in
the aisles. Elated with the success of his
method, the Inger looked round at the
seated men, screened by newspapers, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
reached out to the nearest one, slipped his
hand in his collar, and jerked him to his feet.</p>

<p>The man whirled on him in amazement and
then in a wrath which reddened his face to
fever. But for a breath he hesitated before
the sheer bulk of the Inger.</p>

<p>“You’ll be locked up by dark,” he said
only, “<i>I</i> don’t need to get you.”</p>

<p>He treated himself to a deliberate, luxurious
look at Lory, leaned negligently against the
shoulder of the man seated nearest, and went
back to his newspaper.</p>

<p>It seemed incredible that one should ride
for an hour on a street car to get anywhere.
At the end of ten minutes the Inger had gone
back to the platform and:</p>

<p>“Say,” he said. “We wasn’t goin’ in the
country, you know.”</p>

<p>The conductor went on counting transfers.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;” the Inger went on, slightly louder,
and the man glanced up imperturbably.</p>

<p>“I says I’d leave you off, didn’t I?” he
demanded. “It’s ten mile yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten miles! The Inger stood by Lory and
looked at the streets. Amazing piles of dirty
masonry, highways of dirty stone, processions
of carts, armies of people.</p>

<p>“He lied,” he thought. “They couldn’t
keep it up for ten miles.”</p>

<p>When at last the two were set down, it was
on one of those vast, treeless stretches outside
Chicago, where completed sidewalks cut the
uncompleted lengths of sand and coarse grass,
and where an occasional house stands out
like a fungus&mdash;as quickly evolved as a fungus,
too, and almost as parti-colored. But these
open spaces the two hailed in thanksgiving.</p>

<p>The Inger dropped his pack and stretched
mightily.</p>

<p>“What’d they want to go and muss up the
earth for?” he said. “It’s good enough for
me, naked.”</p>

<p>The girl footed beside him, looking everywhere
in wonder. Her scarlet handkerchief
cap had slipped sidewise on her hair which was
loosened and fallen on her neck. Her dress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of some rough brown, was scant and short,
and it was tight on her full arms and bosom,
beneath a little blue knit shawl that had been
her mother’s. But she was as lovely here as
ever she had been in the desert and on Whiteface.
And as soon as they were alone, the
Inger always fell silent, with the perpetual
sense of trying to understand.</p>

<p>The days on the train had not left them
as their meeting had found them. There had
been hours, side by side, drawing over the
burning yellow and rose of their desert; and
over the flat emptiness and fulness of Kansas;
nights on the rear platform, close to the
rail, so that the overhead lights should not
extinguish the stars; hours when the train
waited for a bridge to be mended, and they
had walked on the prairie, and secretly had
been homesick for the friendly huddling
shapes against the horizons. To the Inger,
with the Flag-pole for his background, the
luxury of a Pullman had occurred no more
than to Lory. It was a way for some folk to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
ride, as diamonds were for certain folk to
buy. But as for them, they had sat in the
day-coach, and at night had laid their heads
on their packs, as simply as they had eaten
the remains of their lunch, and of food
snatched at station counters.</p>

<p>And all the way, he had been trying to
understand. She was very gentle with him&mdash;sometimes
he felt as if she were almost pitying.
Always she seemed the elder. How
was it possible, he wondered, that she could
be to him like this?</p>

<p>For in these days he had come to understand
her, with a man’s curiously clear
understanding of a “good” woman. He knew
the crystal candor of her, the wholesomeness,
the humanness, and, for all her merriment
and her charm and her comradeship, the exquisite
aloofness of her, a quality as strange
in Jem Moor’s daughter as it was unusual in
any womanhood of Inch. But, these things
being so, how was it possible that she could
tolerate him? She could not have forgiven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
him&mdash;that was unthinkable, and, he dimly
felt, undesirable. How then could she be to
him so gentle, so genuinely human?</p>

<p>Of exactly what had occurred that night on
Whiteface, he could not be sure. He wearied
himself, trying to remember what he had
said, what he had done. Of one thing he was
certain: he had not laid his hands on her.
That he should have remembered, and that,
he knew, she would not have let pass by
as she was letting memory of that night
pass. Yet it was the same thing, for he
had tried. What, then, exactly, was she
thinking?</p>

<p>These things he did not cease to turn in his
mind. And bit by bit it seemed to him that
he understood: for at first, on the mountain,
she had needed him. Without him she could
not have followed that imperceptible trail.
Then, here on the train, she was deeply his
debtor, as he had forced her to be. Whatever,
in her heart, she was thinking of him,
she could not now reveal to him. Indeed how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
was it possible that she did not despise him?
So, as she had sat beside him on the Overland,
he had been torturing himself.</p>

<p>Yet never once did her gentleness to him
fail. There was, in her manner now, as she
spoke to him, something of this incomparable
care:</p>

<p>“Will you do something?” she said, looking
away from him.</p>

<p>“If it’s for you, I reckon you can reckon
on it,” he said.</p>

<p>“I donno who it’s for,” she told him. “But
will you be just as nice to my uncle as you are
to me?”</p>

<p>He stared at her.</p>

<p>“Be kind of polite to him,” she said.
“Don’t pull your revolver on him,” she
explained.</p>

<p>“I hardly ever pull my revolver,” he
defended himself indignantly.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t shake him or&mdash;or lift him
up by the collar for anything,” she suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh,” he comprehended. “You want me
to trot out my Chicago manners&mdash;is that it?
He laughed. “All right,” he said. “I’m on.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Hiram is good,” she cried earnestly.
“He come to see us, once&mdash;he’s good!
You treat him right&mdash;please.”</p>

<p>The Inger sunk his chin on his chest and
walked, mulling this. So she hadn’t liked
his way with folks! He felt vaguely uneasy,
and as if he had stumbled on some unsuspected
standard of hers.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said, troubled, “what
Aunt ’Cretia’s goin’ to think. I mean about
your coming with me.”</p>

<p>He raised his head.</p>

<p>“What about me coming with you?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>Before the clear candor of his eyes, her
own fell.</p>

<p>“She’ll think the truth,” he blazed, “or
I’ll burn the house down!”</p>

<p>At this they both laughed, and now it was
she who was feeling a dim shame, as if from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
some high standard of his, she had been the
one to vary.</p>

<p>At the intersection of two paved roads,
whose sidewalks were grass-grown, in their
long waiting for footsteps, stood the house
which they had been seeking. It was of
dullish blue clapboards whose gabled ends
were covered with red-brown toothed shingles.
The house was too high for its area, and a
hideous porch of cement blocks and posts
looked like a spreading cow-catcher. On
a clothes line, bed blankets and colored
quilts were flapping, as if they were rejoicing
in their one legitimate liberty from
privacy.</p>

<p>Everywhere, on the porch, and on the
scrubby lawn, and within the open door,
stood packing boxes. The leap of alarm
which Lory felt at sight of them was not
allayed by the unknown woman in blue
calico, with swathed head, who bent over
the box in the hall.</p>

<p>At Lory’s question, the woman stared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“You mean the family that’s just went out
of here?” she asked. “Well, they’ve moved
to Washington, D.C.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried the Inger, suddenly.</p>

<p>“If you mean the family that’s just went
out of here&mdash;” the woman was beginning.</p>

<p>The Inger struck his hand sharply on the
post.</p>

<p>“We mean Mr. and Mrs. Hiram Folts,”
he shouted. “And if you’re trying to be
insulting&mdash;”</p>

<p>The woman looked at him, open-mouthed.</p>

<p>“Why, my land,” she said, “I never heard
their names in my life. I just happened to
know the family moved to Washington.
You better ask next door&mdash;mebbe they
knew ’em.”</p>

<p>Lory interposed, thanked her, got back to
the street.</p>

<p>“S’posin’ she <i>was</i> puttin’ on,” she urged.
“It don’t hurt us any.”</p>

<p>“Puttin’ on,” raged the Inger. “Well, I
should say. Pretendin’ not to know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
name of whoever moved out of the same
house she’s movin’ into!”</p>

<p>It was true, the neighbor told them. Mr.
and Mrs. Hiram Folts had been gone for
almost a month. She found the Washington
address for them, and in a moment they were
back on the Illinois prairie again, with grass-grown
sidewalks leading them nowhere.</p>

<p>“I must look for a job,” Lory said, only.
“I must begin now and look for a job.”</p>

<p>The Inger’s look travelled over the waste
stretches, cut by neat real estate signs. The
sun was struggling through a high fog, the sky
was murky, and on the horizon where Chicago
lay, the black smoke hung like storm clouds.</p>

<p>“What a devil of a hole,” he said. “It
looks like something had swelled up big, and
bust, and scattered all over the place.”</p>

<p>“I donno how to look for a job,” Lory
said only, staring toward that black horizon
cloud where lay the city.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to go on to Washington?”
the Inger asked casually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Lory shook her head.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” she said. “An’ I ain’t goin’ to
come down on to you again.”</p>

<p>He looked down at her, and for the first
time since they had boarded the Overland,
he saw the hunted look in her eyes. She was
turning toward the City with exactly the
look with which she had turned, over shoulder,
toward Inch and Bunchy.</p>

<p>... He looked at her bright fallen hair,
at the white curve of her throat, at the strong
brown hand with which she held her pack
that she steadfastly refused to let him carry.
Here she was, remote from all the places and
people that she had ever known. Here she
was, almost penniless. He thought of her
bright insolence as she had sat his horse that
morning on the desert, of her breathless
appeal to him in the dark of his hut, of her
self-sufficiency in the night of his cowardice
and failure.... Now here she was, haunted
by another fear.</p>

<p>In the days of their comradeship, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
felt in her presence shame, humility, the
desire to protect; and passion, steadfastly
put down by the memory of that night for
which he was trying desperately to make
amends. But never till that moment had he
felt for her a flash of tenderness. Now&mdash;it
must have been the brown hand nearest
him, on her pack, which so moved him&mdash;he
felt a great longing just to give her comfort
and strength and a moment of cherishing.</p>

<p>She looked up at him. And abruptly, and
with no warning, it seemed to the Inger as
they walked there together, and he looking
down at her, that he <i>was</i> she. He seemed to
move as she moved, to be breathing as she
breathed, to be looking from her eyes at that
storm-cloud of a city lying in wait for her.
For an instant of time, he seemed to cease to
exist of himself, and to be wholly Lory. Then
she looked away, and he lifted his eyes to the
flat green and brown, and was striding on,
himself again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“I never thought of it before,” he burst
out. “It <i>is</i> a job to be a woman. And alone
in Chicago&mdash;Lord!”</p>

<p>Her look flashed back at him.</p>

<p>“I can get along just as well there, or anywhere
else, as you can,” she challenged.</p>

<p>Going back on the car, he argued it with
her. Why should they not go on to Washington.
His bank was to telegraph him
funds&mdash;these were probably waiting for him
now. Why should she not find work with her
aunt, in Washington as well as in Chicago&mdash;and
be that much farther from Bunchy in
the bargain?</p>

<p>She listened, imperturbably bought a newspaper,
and looked out an employment agency;
and ended by being left at the agency while
the Inger went off to the telegraph office.</p>

<p>He had gone but a step or two when he
felt her touch on his arm.</p>

<p>“And oh, listen!” she said. “If the money
ain’t come, don’t <i>kill</i> the man!”</p>

<p>He laughed, a great ringing laugh that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
made the passers-by on Wabash Avenue look
amusedly after him. Then he strode off
among them. At intervals, all the way to
the telegraph office, he cursed the town.
The noise confused him, the smoke blinded
and choked him, he understood nobody’s
talk of “east” and “west.” Unmercifully he
jostled people who got in his way, and he
pushed by them, unmindful of remonstrance.
At a corner a traffic policeman roared out at
him to halt. He stared at the officer, then
leaped on the running board of a motor that
was making a left-hand turn, and dropped
off on the other side of the causeway.</p>

<p>“Get a grown man’s job, little fellow!” he
yelled in derision.</p>

<p>He could find neither the signs nor the
numbers. The beat of the traffic made
indistinguishable the voices of those who
tried to reply to his questions. To the fifth
or sixth man whom he sought to understand,
he roared out in a terrible voice:</p>

<p>“My Lord, haven’t you got any lungs?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The man fled. The Inger tramped on, to
a chant which was growing in his soul:</p>

<p>“Give me Inch. Give me Inch. Give me
Inch....”</p>

<p>But by the time he had gained the telegraph
office, and the man at the window,
after long delay, had told him that identification
would be necessary before he could
collect his money, the Inger’s mood had
changed. He stood before the window and
broke into a roar of laughter.</p>

<p>“Identify me!” he said. “Me! Why,
man, I’m Inger. I own the Flag-pole mine.
I just got here, from Inch, Balboa County.
You might as well try to identify the West
coast. Look at me, you fool!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Inger,” said the man,
respectfully. “You’ll have to bring somebody
here who knows you. A resident.”</p>

<p>“There ain’t a resident of nothing this side
the Rockies that ever laid eyes to me,” said
the Inger. “You guess twice.”</p>

<p>The clerk meditated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Haven’t you got your name on something
about you?” he said softly.</p>

<p>The Inger thought. He rarely had a letter,
he never carried one. He had never in his
life owned a business card or an embroidered
initial. Suddenly his face cleared.</p>

<p>“You bet!” he cried, and drew his six-shooter,
which the men at the mines had
given him, and levelled it through the bars.</p>

<p>“There’s my name on the handle,” he said.
“Want I should fire, just to prove it’s mine?”</p>

<p>The man hesitated, glanced once about
the office, looked in the Inger’s eyes,&mdash;and
risked his job.</p>

<p>“That’ll be sufficient,” said he. “But if
you’ll allow me, you’d best cover that thing
up.”</p>

<p>“I donno,” said the Inger, reflectively,
“but I’d best shoot my way down State
Street. I don’t seem to get along very fast
any other way.”</p>

<p>He had one more visit to make. This was
to a railway ticket office, where he deliberately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
made a purchase and took away a time-card.
Then he returned to the employment office.</p>

<p>There he faced a curious sight. The
outer room was small and squalid with its
bare, dirty floor, its discolored walls, the
dusty, curtainless panes of its one window
which looked in on a dingy court. About
the edge of the room, either seated on deal
benches without backs, or standing by the
wall, were perhaps twenty women. They
were old, they were young, they were relaxed
and hopeless, or tense and strained&mdash;but
the most of them were middle-aged and
shabby and utterly negligible. They had
not the character of the defeated or the ill or
the wretched. They were simply drained of
life, and were living. Occasionally an inner
door opened and a man’s voice called “Next.”
Few of the women talked. One or two of
them slept. The window was closed and the
air was intolerable.</p>

<p>To all this it took the Inger a moment or
two to accustom his eyes. Then he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Lory. She was sitting on her pack, on the
floor, amusing a fretting baby on the knees
of its mother, who dozed. In that dun place,
the girl’s loveliness was startling, electric.
The women felt it, and some sat staring at her.</p>

<p>“If I had that face&mdash;” he caught from one.</p>

<p>“Come along out of this, for the Lord’s
sake!” said the Inger.</p>

<p>They all turned toward him and toward
Lory as she rose, crimsoning as they looked at
her. She went to the doorway where he stood.</p>

<p>“I’ll lose my turn if I come now,” she said.</p>

<p>He held her wrist and drew her into the
hall. Other women were waiting to get into
the room. Well-dressed, watching men went
and came.</p>

<p>“You come with me,” said the Inger.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;” she tried to say.</p>

<p>“You come along with me,” he repeated.
And as her troubled look questioned him:</p>

<p>“I’ve got two tickets to Washington,” he
said. “You don’t want no job here if you
get one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“You hadn’t ought&mdash;” she began, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“I know it,” he told her. “What I’d
ought to ’a’ done was to get two tickets to
Whiteface and the hut. Hadn’t I?”</p>

<p>The baby, deserted, began to cry weakly.
Lory turned back to her, stooped over her,
comforted her. As he stood there, leaning
in the doorway, once more there came to the
Inger that curiously sharp sense of the morning
on the prairie.</p>

<p>For a flash as he looked at those empty
faces and worn figures, he knew&mdash;positively
and as at first hand&mdash;what it was to be, not
Lory alone now, but all the rest. Abruptly,
with some great wrench of the understanding,
it was almost as if momentarily he were those
other wretched creatures. When Lory had
brought her pack and joined him, he stood
for a moment, still staring into that room.</p>

<p>“My God,” he said. “I wish I could do
something for ’em!”</p>

<p>He struggled with this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Seems as if it’d help if I’d canter in and
shoot every one of ’em dead,” he said.</p>

<p class="p2">They went out on the street again, intent
on finding a place to lunch. There were two
hours until the Washington train left. The
Inger refusing utterly to ask anybody anything,
they walked until they came to a place
which, by hot flapjacks in the making in the
great window, the Inger loudly recognized to
be his own.</p>

<p>Seated at a little white oil-cloth covered
table beneath which the Inger insisted on
stowing the packs, the two relaxed in that
moment of rest and well-being.</p>

<p>The Inger, seeing her there across from him,
spoke out in a kind of wonder.</p>

<p>“It seems like I can’t remember the time
when you wasn’t along,” he said.</p>

<p>She laughed&mdash;and it was pathetic to see
how an interval of comfort and quiet warmed
her back to security and girlishness. But
not to the remotest coquetry. Of that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
since the morning on the desert, he had had
in her no glimpse. By this he knew dimly
all that he had forfeited. He made wistful
attempts to call forth even a shadow of her
old way.</p>

<p>“A week ago,” he said, “I hardly knew
you.”</p>

<p>She assented gravely, and found no more
to say about it.</p>

<p>“A week ago,” he said, “I was fishing, and
didn’t bring home nothin’ but a turtle.” He
smiled at a recollection. “I was scrapin’
him out,” he said, “when I heard your
weddin’ bell. How’d you ever come to have
a weddin’ bell?” he wondered.</p>

<p>“It was Bunchy’s doing,” she said, listlessly.
“He sent the priest a case o’ somethin’,
to have it rung. I hated it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Inger, “it was Bunchy’s
own rope, then, that hung him. I shouldn’t
have come down if I hadn’t heard the bell&mdash;”
he paused perplexed. “You didn’t know I
was down there, though?” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I thought you’d be up on the mountain
when I went up. I didn’t think you’d
be in town. You hardly ever,” she added,
“did come down.”</p>

<p>He did not miss this: she had noticed,
then, that he hardly ever came down.</p>

<p>“When I did come,” he said, “I always
saw you with Bunchy. Only that once.”</p>

<p>“Only that once,” she assented, and did
not meet his eyes. “Oh!” she cried, “I’ll be
glad when we get to Washington and I’m off
your hands! That’s why I wanted a job
here&mdash;to be off your hands!”</p>

<p>On this the Inger was stabbed through
with his certainty. It was true, then. She
was longing to be free of him&mdash;and no
wonder! To hide his hurt and his chagrin
he turned to the waiter, who was arriving
with flapjacks, and lifted candidly inquiring
eyes.</p>

<p>“See anything the matter with my hands?”
he drawled.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said the man, in surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, neither do I,” said the Inger.
“What <i>is</i> the matter with ’em?” he demanded
of Lory, as the man departed.</p>

<p>“Why, if it wasn’t for me on ’em,” said
Lory, “you’d be starting for war.”</p>

<p>War! The Inger heard the word in astonishment.
That was so, he <i>had</i> been going to
the war. He had been bent on going to the
war, and had so announced his intention.
In that day on the mountain, those days
on the train, these hours in the city, he had
never once thought of war. He flooded his
flapjacks with syrup, and said nothing.</p>

<p>“Washington ain’t <i>much</i> out of your way,”
she added. “You can get started by day
after to-morrow anyway.”</p>

<p>Still he was silent. Then, feeling that
something was required of him, he observed
nonchalantly:</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t have to talk about it
now, as I know of.”</p>

<p>In this, however, he reckoned without his
host of the restaurant. As the Inger paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the bill, there was thrust in his hands a white
poster, printed in great letters:</p>

<p class="pc1 large">GIANT MASS MEETING</p>
<p class="pc lmid">THE COLISEUM</p>
<p class="pc mid">TO-NIGHT! TO-NIGHT! TO-NIGHT!</p>
<p class="pc">WHAT IS AMERICA<br />
TO DO<br />
IN THE PRESENT CRISIS</p>

<p class="p1">The Inger read it through twice.</p>

<p>“What crisis?” he asked.</p>

<p>The restaurant keeper&mdash;a man with meeting
eyebrows, who looked as if he had just
sipped something acid&mdash;stopped counting
change in piles, and stared at him.</p>

<p>“Where you from?” he asked, and saw the
packs, and added “Boat, eh? Ain’t you
heard about the vessel?”</p>

<p>The Inger shook his head.</p>

<p>“Well, man,” said the restaurant keeper
with enjoyment, “another nice big U. S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
merchantman is blowed into flinders a couple
o’ days ago, a-sailin’ neutral seas. Nobody
much killed, I guess&mdash;but leave ’em wait
and see what we give ’em!”</p>

<p>“Does it mean war?” asked the Inger,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“That’s for the meetin’ to say,” said the
man, and winked, and, still winking, reached
for somebody’s pink check.</p>

<p>The Inger turned to Lory with eyes alight.</p>

<p>“Let’s get a train in the night,” he said.
“Let’s stay here for this meeting.”</p>

<p>In the circumstances, there was nothing
that she could well say against this. She
nodded. The Inger consulted his timetable,
found a train toward morning, and
the thing was done. He left the place like
a boy.</p>

<p>“Let’s see some of this Mouth o’ the Pit
this afternoon,” he said, “being we’re here.
And then we’ll head for that war meeting.
It’s grand we got here for it,” he
added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Lory looked up at him in a kind of fear.
On the mountain that night she had not once
really feared him. But here, she now understood,
was a man with whom, in their days
together, she had after all never yet come
face to face.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">VI</h2>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">They</span> sat where they could see the great
audience gather. The people came by thousands.
They poured in the aisles, advanced,
separated, sifted into the rows of seats,
climbed to the boxes, the galleries, ranged
along those sloping floors like puppets. The
stage filled. There were men and women,
young, old, clothed in a mass of black shot
through with color. Here were more people
than ever in their lives Lory or the Inger had
seen. The stage alone was a vast audience
hall.</p>

<p>The people talked. A dull roar came from
them, fed by voices, by shuffling feet, by the
moving of garments and papers and bodies.
They all moved. No one was still. The
human mass, spread so thinly in the hollow
shell of the hall, moved like maggots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The Inger leaned forward, watching. His
eyes were lit and his breath quickened. His
huge frame obscured the outlook of a little
white-faced youth who sat beside him, continually
stroking and twisting at a high and
small moustache.</p>

<p>“Sit back, sir, can’t you?” this exasperated
youth finally demanded.</p>

<p>The Inger, his hand spread massively as he
leaned on his leg, tossed him a glance, over
shoulder, and with lifted brows.</p>

<p>“Why, you little lizard,” he observed,
only, and did not change his posture.</p>

<p>A group of men and women in evening
clothes sat beside Lory, who frankly stared at
them. One of the women, elderly, pallidly
powdered, delicately worn down by long,
scrupulous care of her person, sat with one
blue and boned hand in evidence, heavily
clad with rings.</p>

<p>“Look at the white bird’s claw,” the
Inger said suddenly. “I’d like to snap it
off its bloomin’ stem.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>And as the people ceased to come in, and
now were merely sitting there, breathing,
and incredibly alive, he suddenly spoke aloud:</p>

<p>“If hundreds of ’em fell dead and was
dragged out,” he said, “we’d never know the
difference, would we?”</p>

<p>Lory’s look was the speculative look which
always embarrassed him.</p>

<p>“If two of ’em was us, we would,” she said.</p>

<p>The Inger laughed boisterously.</p>

<p>“You bet,&mdash;then!” he agreed. “Lord,
ain’t it grand that the rest of ’em could go, for
all we care!”</p>

<p>She pondered it.</p>

<p>“What if they was a big fire,” she said,
“like the Hess House?”</p>

<p>The Hess House, an unsavory place of
Inch, had burned the year before, and with
it five nameless women.</p>

<p>“Oh gosh,” said the Inger, “you could
hand ’em out like fish off the coals, and save
’em, alive and kicking, and cord ’em up
somewheres, and rip back for more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why?” asked Lory. “Why would you do
that&mdash;if it didn’t make any difference?”</p>

<p>“Because you’d be a dub if you didn’t,”
he replied simply.</p>

<p>He was silent for a minute, played at picking
her up in his arms, holding her, hewing
through the crowd, trampling them out of the
way, and as he went, kissing her when he
pleased. To him the hall dimmed and went
out.... Then he heard the chairman speaking.</p>

<p>The chairman was a man of thick body and
bent head, with watching eyes, and a mouth
that shut as a fist shuts. His voice went
over the hall like a horn.</p>

<p>The meeting had been called because something
must be done&mdash;something must be
done. The war had dragged on until the
world was sucked. Men, women, children,
money, arms, cities, nations, were heaped on
the wreck. The wreck <i>was</i> the world. Something
must be done&mdash;something must be
done. In all the earth stood only one great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
nation, untouched of carnage, fat, peopled&mdash;and
peopled with sons of the warring world.
This meeting had been called because something
must be done. There were those who
had come to tell what to do.</p>

<p>To those who comprehended, the weight of
the moment lay in the chaos of applause
which took the house. The air of the place,
languid, silent, casual, for all that one observed,
abruptly solidified and snapped, and
flew asunder. In its place leaped something
electric, which played from the people to the
speaker who came first to his place, and from
him back to the people.</p>

<p>This man began to speak slowly. He was
slow-moving, slow of eyelid and of glance,
and his words came half sleepily. It was so
that he told them about themselves: Children
of those who had come to America for escape,
for retreat, for a place of self-expression. Who
had sought liberty, free schools, manhood suffrage,
womanhood suffrage, religious freedom,
and had found some of these and were seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
more. Picture by picture he showed them a
country which, save for its enduring era of industrial
babyhood, and its political and judicial
error, gave them richly of what they had
sought, developed them, fed them, comforted
them. A place of plenty, a happy paradise, a
walled world, he pictured theirs.</p>

<p>In the same sleepy, casual fashion, he went
on: Why should they set about all this talk
of “something must be done”? This was
none of our quarrel. Perfectly, by this time,
we recognized its causes as capitalistic issues.
If they chose to murder one another, should
we add terror unto terror by slaying more,
and ourselves? Why ourselves and our sons?
Why not stay soft in the nest we had made,
while men of the soil which had nourished our
fathers called to us vainly, the death rattle in
their throats? Sigh delicately for this rattle
of death in millions of throats and fill our own
with the fat of the land whose prosperity must
not be imperilled. Read of a people decimated,
and answer by filing a protest. Pray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
for peace incessantly, beside our comfortable
beds. Read of atrocities and shudder in our
warm libraries. Hear of dead men who fought
and dead men who rotted, and talk it over on
our safe, sunlit streets. Meet insult on the
high seas, and merely hold mass meetings.
And speculate, speculate, speculate, at our
laden dinner tables, on the probable outcome.</p>

<p>“The part of men is being played by us all,”
the slow voice went on, “of men and of descendants
of men of Europe. It was so that they
acted in ’76&mdash;the men of Europe, was it not?
And we are the sons of those who, before ’76,
made Europe as they made America&mdash;and
us. The destruction of one of our vessels&mdash;what
is that to us? Let’s turn the other
cheek. And let’s meet here often, friends,
what do you say? Here it is warm and
light&mdash;you come from good dinners&mdash;you
come in good clothes&mdash;in automobiles. Let
us meet to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow!
Let us have music&mdash;Where is
the music to-night? ‘Tipperary’&mdash;‘Marseillaise’&mdash;‘Wacht<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Am Rhein’&mdash;‘God Save
the King’&mdash;why are we not being stirred by
these to sign a protest, to take a collection
which shall keep them fighting on? ‘Something
must be done!’ So we meet&mdash;and
meet&mdash;and meet again. And we play a part
that in the history of the next century will
make the very schoolboys say: ‘Thank God,
America locked her door and kept her safety
and let them die!’ Next week&mdash;let us
meet here again next week, pleasantly and
together. ‘Something must be done!’ In
the name of all the bleeding nations, let us
keep on meeting, in this large and lighted
hall.”</p>

<p>Before the silence in which he turned away
had been rent by the applause that followed
on the surprise of it, another man sprang
from his seat on the stage and strode to the
front. In a gesture curiously awkward and
involuntary, he signed them to let him speak,
and his voice burst out before they could hear
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“... he is right&mdash;he is right&mdash;and I
burn in flesh and soul and blood and bone
of these peoples of Europe who made me.
Their flesh cries to my flesh and it answers
with a tongue that has been dumb too long.
Men of America! Men who have lately been
sons of the warring nations and have crept
off here just in time&mdash;by a decade or by a
century&mdash;to stand with whole skins and
unbroken bones&mdash;let’s have done with it!
Do we face our insults as men&mdash;or do we stand
silent and bid for more? And are we another
kind of creature? Do we understand what
those men suffer? Are their cries of agony
to us in another tongue? Have blood and
misery and madness a language of their own,
and are we deaf to it&mdash;or do we know with
every fibre in us what it is they are going
through, what it is they ask of us, what it is
that if we are men we must give them&mdash;and
give them now! For now their provocation
is our provocation. I ask you what it shall
be&mdash;the safe way of intervention? Or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
hands of human beings, to succor the naked
hands of the desperate and the dying of our
own kin&mdash;our own kin! And to revenge
our wrong!”</p>

<p>In an instant the hall was shattered by a
thousand cries. Men leaped to their feet.
Some sat still. Some wept. But the cries
which came from no one knew whom of them,
rose and roared distinguishably!</p>

<p>“To war ... war ... war!”</p>

<p>The Inger had risen and stood stooping forward,
his hands on the rail, his eyes sweeping
the crowd. His look seemed to lick up something
that it had long wanted, and to burn it
in his face. He was smiling with his teeth
slightly showing.</p>

<p>“Ah-h-h,” he said within his breath, and
said it again, and stood rocking a little and
breathing hard.</p>

<p>The demonstration lasted on as if a pent
presence had lapped them to itself and possessed
them. A man, and another tried to
speak, but no one listened. A few in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
front rows left the hall, and, ominous, and
barely audible, a hissing began in the galleries
and ran down the great bank of heads, and
scourged the few as they gained the door.</p>

<p>What at last silenced them was the dignity
and status of a man who took the stage. He
made no effort to speak. He merely waited.
Presently they were quiet, though not all
reseated themselves.</p>

<p>He was a man of more than middle years,
with a face worn and tortured&mdash;but it was as
if the torture had been long ago.</p>

<p>“My neighbors,” he said, “will some one tell
me why you want to kill your neighbors
across the water?”</p>

<p>“To vindicate our honor! To <i>help</i> our
neighbors and our kin!” shouted the lean
man who had spoken last.</p>

<p>The older man regarded him quietly:</p>

<p>“You want to kill your neighbors,” he
repeated. “You want to go over there with
arms and be at war. You want to <i>kill</i> your
neighbors. I am asking you why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>From the upper gallery came a cry that was
like a signal. Up there a hundred throats took
up a national hymn. Instantly from the
balconies below, from pit, from stage, a
thousand were on their feet and a thousand
throats took up the air. Not an instant later,
something cut the current of the tune,
wavered, broke, swelled&mdash;and another nation’s
hymn, by another thousand, rose and
bore upon the first, and the two shook the
place with discord. A third nation’s air&mdash;a
fourth&mdash;the hall was a warfare of jarring
voices&mdash;and out of the horror of sound came
the old exquisite phrases, struggling for dominance:
“God Save the Queen”&mdash;”Watch
on the Rhine,” “The Marseillaise,” “The
Italian Hymn,” and rollicking over all, the
sickening wistfulness and hopelessness and
sweetness of “Tipperary.”</p>

<p>The Inger raised his great form and
stretched up his arms and shook them above
his head, and swung out his right arm as if
it flung a rope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yi&mdash;eih&mdash;ai&mdash;la&mdash;o-o-o-oh&mdash;!” he
shouted, like the cry of all the galloping cow-punchers
of the West, galloping, and galloping,
to a thing on which, with sovereign intensity,
they were bent. He silenced those about him,
and they looked and laughed, and gave themselves
back to their shouting. The woman
with the blue-boned hand looked over to
Lory, and smiled with a liquid brightness in
her eyes, and her pink spangled fan tapped
her hand in tune with the nearest of the songs
about her. This woman looked like a woman
of the revolution, who believed that good has
always come out of war, and that from war
good will always come. She smiled. Tears
rolled on her face. She sank back weakly,
but she waved her pink spangled fan.</p>

<p>As his hand came down, Lory caught at the
Inger’s sleeve.</p>

<p>“Can’t we go?” she begged. “Can’t we?”</p>

<p>He pulled his sleeve from her hand, hardly
knowing that it was there, and kept at his
shouting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The only man to whom they would listen
was, at last, the man who had so roused them.
When, after a hurried conference with the
chairman, and others, this man rose again,
they listened&mdash;in the vague expectation that
something would now be said which would
excite them further.</p>

<p>“Don’t be senseless fools!” he shouted.
“This is no better than a neat, printed protest.
‘Something must be <i>done</i>!’ Say what
it is that you are going to do, or you may as
well go home.”</p>

<p>He turned pointedly toward a dark-bearded
man who was evidently expected to follow him.
This man rose and shook out a paper. He
shouted shrilly and wagged his head in his
effort to make himself heard, and his long hair
swung at the sides.</p>

<p>“At this moment,” he rehearsed, “eighteen
meetings such as this are being held in
eighteen towns&mdash;New York, Baltimore, New
Orleans, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Salt
Lake, Denver, Omaha, Portland, Spokane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
St. Louis, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Milwaukee&mdash;these
and the others are holding meetings
like this. You know how each meeting is
to take action and transmit that action
to-night to each of the other meeting places.
I ask you: what is it that this meeting is
going to do? And Mr. Chairman, I make
you a motion.”</p>

<p>The hall was so silent that it seemed drained
of breathing: so electric with listening that
it seemed drained of thought.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, ay, and
Ladies, for I deem you fully worthy to have a
share in these deliberations,” said he, with
a magnificent bow. “I move you, that,
Whereas our government in its wisdom has
seen fit to withhold itself from the great
drama of the world’s business for a length of
time not to be tolerated by a great mass of its
citizens: and, Whereas, since the destruction
of the steamship <i>Fowler</i>, a merchant vessel,
belonging to the United States and sailing
neutral waters, three days have elapsed without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
action on the part of the government
thus outraged past all precedent in conduct
toward neutral nations&mdash;save only one nation!&mdash;That
now, therefore, we here assembled,
citizens of the United States, do
voice our protest and demand of our government
that if within the week no adequate
explanation or apology shall be forthcoming
from the offending power, we do proceed without
further delay to declare war against that
power.</p>

<p>“And I further move you that it be the
sense of this meeting that we hereby petition
for immediate mobilization of our army.</p>

<p>“And I further move you that, on the carrying
of this motion, a copy of it be telegraphed
to the President of the United States, and
to the Chairmen of the eighteen similar
meetings held in the United States this night,
in the common name of liberty and humanity.”</p>

<p>The hall became a medley of sound with
but one meaning. Men leaped to the seats,
to the rails of balconies, shouting. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
thing they had wanted to have said had been
said. The fire that had been smouldering
since early in the war, that had occasionally
blazed in public meetings, in the press, in
private denunciation, had at last eaten through
the long silence to burn now with a devouring
flame, and the people gave it fuel.</p>

<p>A dozen men and women there were who
fought their way forward, and stood on the
platform, appealing for silence. One by one
these tried to speak. To each the hall listened
until it had determined the temper of the
speaker: then, if it was, as it was from several,
a passionate denunciation of the policy,
groans and hisses drowned the speaker’s
voice. And if it was a ringing cry of “Patriots
of the world, show your patriotism in
the cause of the stricken world and of this
offended nation!”&mdash;the fury of applauding
hands and stamping feet silenced speech no
less.</p>

<p>“Question! Question! Question!” they
called&mdash;not here and there and otherwhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
but in a great wave of hoarse shouting, like a
pulse.</p>

<p>The Chairman rose to put the motion, and
as silence fell for him to speak, a youth of
twenty, lithe, dark, with a face of the fineness
of some race more like to all peoples than
peoples now are like to one another, hurled himself
before him, and shouted into the quiet:</p>

<p>“Comrades! Comrades! In the name of
God&mdash;of the hope of the International....”</p>

<p>A yell went up from the hall. A dozen
hands drew the youth away. He waved his
arms toward the hall. From above and below,
came voices&mdash;some of men, some of women,
hoarse or clear or passionate:</p>

<p>“Comrades! Comrades!...”</p>

<p>But in that moment’s breath of another
meaning, the speaker who first had fired
them stood beside the chairman, and held
up a telegram. They let him read:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Resolution almost unanimously
passed by Metropolitan mass meeting
and by two overflow meetings....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">If there was more to the telegram, no one
but the reader knew. The clamor was like
a stretching of hands across the miles to
New York, to clasp those other hands in their
brother-lust. The youth of twenty flung
himself free of those who had held him,
and dropped to the floor, and sat hugging
his knees and staring out over the hall as
if death sat there, infinitely repeated, and
naked.</p>

<p>The Chairman lifted his hand. “You have
heard the motion. Does any one desire to
hear it re-read?”</p>

<p>Again that amazing, pulsing, unanimity of
the cry:</p>

<p>“Question! Question! Question!”</p>

<p>“All those in favor&mdash;” the Chairman’s
bent head was raised so that he peered at
them from under his lids&mdash;“will make it
manifest by saying ‘ay.’”</p>

<p>Out of the depth of their experience and
practice at meetings for charity, for philanthropy,
for church, for state, for home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
they voted, so that it was like One Great
Thing with a voice of its own.</p>

<p>“Ay!”</p>

<p>In this “ay” the Inger’s voice boomed out
so that some remembered and wondered, and
even in that moment, a few turned to see
him.</p>

<p>“Those opposed will make it manifest by
saying ‘no.’”</p>

<p>The boy sprang to his feet, and with the
clear call of a few hundred no’s, his own voice
rang out in agony:</p>

<p>“Oh my God,” he said, “No! No! No!”</p>

<p>There must have been a thousand who
laughed at him and called him a name. But
the others were gone wild again. And with
them the Inger was shouting his wildest, so
that for a moment he did not hear Lory.
Then he realized that she was standing beside
him crying with the few hundred their
‘No!’”</p>

<p>He took her by the shoulder and shook her
roughly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you want to do that for?” he
said. “Are you a white feather?”</p>

<p>It smote him with dull surprise that she
was so calm.</p>

<p>She answered him as she might have spoken
on the mountain trail:</p>

<p>“If that means that I ain’t like them,” she
said, “then I am a white feather, I guess.”</p>

<p>“But look here,” he burst out, “you’re
no mollycoddle. You’re the West! You
know how things go&mdash;”</p>

<p>She broke in then, with her face turned
toward the hall again.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “I know how things go.
They’re voting to kill folks&mdash;Oh my God!”</p>

<p>The Inger blazed up in a flame.</p>

<p>“It ain’t any such thing!” he burst out.
“They don’t care a hang about killing folks&mdash;not
for the fun o’ killing!”</p>

<p>He hurled his new fact at her, passionately
anxious that she should understand.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see?” he cried. “It’s for
somethin’&mdash;it’s <i>for</i> somethin’! That’s all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the difference. It’s grand! It’s&mdash;it’s grand&mdash;”
He shook with his effort to make her
know.</p>

<p>“It’s killing ’em just as dead!” she said,
and she wept.</p>

<p>Here the Inger received an unexpected ally.
The woman with the blue-boned hand beside
Lory leaned forward, and touched the girl’s
arm with her pink, spangled fan:</p>

<p>“My child,” she said, “try to understand:
killing is so small a part of it all!”</p>

<p>Lory faced her, and her eyes blazed into
the faded eyes of her.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see your father kill a
sheriff?” she asked. “Well, mine did&mdash;and
I watched him. And I tell you, no matter
how murderin’ is done, it’s hell. If you don’t
know that, take it from me!”</p>

<p>About them, the crowd, waiting for no adjournment,
was rising, streaming out, falling
back as it got to the doors. The Inger,
marshalling Lory before him, made his way
with the rest. He looked across Lory’s head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and above most of the others. He was noticing
the people.</p>

<p>There was a fine stalwart lad, he thought&mdash;good
for the army, and looking ready to
shoulder his gun. That chap with the
shoulders&mdash;what a seat he’d have in the
cavalry&mdash;or on a broncho, for the matter of
that. That fellow there was too old, but he
was in excited talk with some one, and both
were as eager as boys. Some were still shouting
to one another, flushed with immediate
purpose. Others were quiet and moved out
soberly, as when the lights come back after
the great climax. But every one was thrilled
and fired by a powerful emotion, and it lived
in their faces. The Inger read it there, because
he felt it in his own. He warmed to
them all.</p>

<p>A man about town, fashionably dressed, and
in absorbed talk, came down on the Inger’s
foot with shocking vigor.</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry!” he exclaimed in a hurrying
falsetto, pitching down three notes of the scale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you give a damn,” said the Inger
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>At the door, in the bewilderment of lights
and carriage calls and traffic, the Inger stood
in complete uncertainty.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me&mdash;” “Say, could you
tell me&mdash;” “Say, which way&mdash;” he addressed
one or two, but in the inner turmoil of them and
in the clamor without, they did not heed him.</p>

<p>The Inger faced the next man, a fat being,
with two nieces&mdash;one knew that they were
nieces; and demanded of him to be told the
way to his station.</p>

<p>“Lord bless me,” said the man. “Get on
any car going that way!”</p>

<p>“Thank you to hell,” said the Inger
heartily. “Hope we’re on the same side,”
he warmed to it. “Hope we’re in the same
regiment!” he mounted with it.</p>

<p>As the two swung out on the sidewalk, he
was silent with the vague mulling of this.</p>

<p>“Could we walk?” Lory suggested. “Is
there time?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>He welcomed it. They went up Wabash
Avenue with the slow-moving crowd.</p>

<p>It had been raining, and the asphalt between
the rails, and the rails themselves, were wet
and shining. The black cobblestones were
covered thinly with glossy mud. Even the
sidewalks palely mirrored the amazing flame
of the lights.</p>

<p>It was another Chicago from the city which
they had entered with the dawn. Here was
a gracious place of warm-looking ways, and
a time of leisure, and the people meant other
than the people of the morning. The Inger
moved among them, swam with them, looked
on them all with something new stirring him.</p>

<p>Lory went silently. She had slipped her
handkerchief cap away, and her hair was
bright and uncovered in the lamplight. But
she seemed not to be looking anywhere.</p>

<p>“You did get on to it there to-night, didn’t
you?” he asked, wistfully.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she said.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;the new part,” he told her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
“Didn’t you notice? Every last one of ’em
was goin’ on about country and folks. <i>That’s
why they want to go.</i>”</p>

<p>She was silent, and he was afraid that she
did not understand.</p>

<p>“I never thought of it till to-night, either,”
he excused her. “Don’t you see? Fellows
don’t want to go to war just to smash around
for a fight. It’s for somethin’ else.”</p>

<p>He stopped, vaguely uncomfortable in his
exaltation.</p>

<p>“It’s killin’,” she said, “an’ killin’ ’s killin’.”</p>

<p>He stood still on the walk, regardless of the
passers, and shook her arm.</p>

<p>“Good heavens,” he said, “women had
ought to see that. Women are better’n men,
and they’d ought to see it! Can’t you get
past the killin’? Can’t you understand they
might have a thunderin’ reason?”</p>

<p>“<i>No</i> reason don’t matter,” she said. “It’s
killin’. And it ain’t anything else.”</p>

<p>He walked on, his head bent, his eyes on
the ground. She knew that he was disappointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
in her&mdash;but she was too much shaken
to think about that. She remembered how
her mother had watched her brother go out
to fight after some mean uprising of drunken
whites against the Indians. Nobody knew
now what it had been about, but six men had
been shot. That stayed.</p>

<p>Presently the Inger raised his head, and
walked with it thrown back again. Women,
he supposed, <i>wouldn’t</i> understand. They were
afraid&mdash;they hated a gun&mdash;they hated a
scratch. There was the woman with the
blue-boned hand and wrist and the pink
spangled fan&mdash;<i>she</i> understood, it seemed.
But somehow that proved nothing, and he
freed his thought of her.</p>

<p>A window of birds took his fancy. The
poor things, trying to sleep in the night light,
were tucked uncomfortably about their cages,
while their soft breasts and wings attracted
to the feather shop possible buyers. The
Inger looked at them, thinking. He turned
excitedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“I get you about that red bird,” he cried,
“when you said not kill it! Well, there
wasn’t any reason for killin’ the red bird&mdash;not
any real reason. I don’t blame you for
rowin’ at it. But can’t you see that killin’
men in war is differ’nt?”</p>

<p>She looked upon him with sudden attention.
While he was being directed to their street,
she stood thinking about what he had said.</p>

<p>“Is that the way you felt about it when you
first said you was going to the war?” she
asked when he joined her.</p>

<p>“Gosh, no,” he replied almost reverently.
“All I been wantin’ to go to war for was to
raise hell&mdash;legitimate. <i>Don’t</i> you see no
differ’nce?” he repeated.</p>

<p>It was then that she began to understand
what a mighty thing had happened to him.
Her insistence that war was merely killing,
was merely murder, had done violence to his
new idealism. And without the skill to correlate
her impressions of this, she divined that
here was something which was showing her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
once more, the measure of this man. And
she saw, too, that now she should not fail
him.</p>

<p>She could say nothing, but as they crossed
the street to the station, she suddenly slipped
her hand within his great swinging arm.</p>

<p>He caught at her hand with a passion that
amazed her. As his own closed over hers, she
drew breathlessly away again.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said. “Maybe it’s late. We
didn’t hurry....”</p>

<p>He made no comment. At the station they
claimed their packs and sat down to wait.
Two hours or more later, as they stood by the
gate, a man with many bundles jostled Lory
and stood beside her, unseeing, with a long
parcel jabbing at her neck. The Inger laid
his great hand on him.</p>

<p>“Say, Snickerfritz,” he said, in perfect good
humor, “lamp the lady there.”</p>

<p>And when the man apologized, the Inger
smiled his slow smile, and waved his huge
hand at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>As he looked at this man and at the tired
woman beside the man, it occurred to the
Inger that these people must all have homes.
This was a thing that he had never thought
about before. Always he had seen people,
as it were, in the one dimension of their personal
presence, taking no account of them
otherwise&mdash;neither of that second dimension
of their inner beings, nor of the third dimension
of their relationships.</p>

<p>“I bet they all got some little old hole they
crawl into,” he said, aloud. And as the gate
opened, and the two filed down the platform
behind the man with the parcels and the tired
woman, the Inger added: “That gink and
his dame&mdash;they looked spliced. Doggone
it, I bet they got a dug-out somewheres!”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said Lory, in surprise. “Sure
they have. What of it?”</p>

<p>“Oh well, I donno,” he mumbled.
“Nothin’ much.”</p>

<p>In the day coach, he turned over a seat, and
in the forward one, he deposited the two packs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t need two seats,” she objected.</p>

<p>“No,” he assented. “You sit down there.”</p>

<p>She sat by the window, and he beside her.
On the way across the desert, she had sat
alone at night, with her pack for a pillow, and
he in a seat near by. She said nothing now,
and when the train began to move, they still
sat in silence, watching the lights wheel and
march, run to the windows, and vanish with
no chance to explain themselves, and an
edge of dawn streaking the sky. When he
saw her eyes droop, he put his arm about her,
and drew her head down until it lay upon his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“I want you should go to sleep there,” he
said.</p>

<p>For a moment he held her so, not the less
tenderly that his great arms would not let her
move. But this obedience was, after all,
not what he wanted. “Do you want to?”
he demanded, and half loosed his clasp.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she answered sleepily&mdash;but
she did not move away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>In a little while she fell asleep, and he sat
so and held her. Her weight became a delicious
discomfort. He was not thinking either
of that night on the trail, or of what might be.
He was hardly thinking at all. He was swept
by the sweetness of the hour and by the sense
of an exalted living, such as he had never
dreamed; an exalted warfare, in which men
killed for great reasons. And once his feeling
was shot through with the recognition that
every one in the car would be believing that
she was his wife; that every one in the car
would be thinking that they had a home somewhere.</p>

<p>He put his lips on her hair, and then rested
his cheek there. So, sleeping, they sped
through that new world.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">VII</h2>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">At</span> Harrisburg, he bought a New York paper.
There have been huge mass meetings in New
York to which only an inch of space was given,
on a back page; but this meeting had the
second column next to the war news. Two
overflow meetings had been held and in all
three, the enthusiasm, the newspaper said, had
been tremendous, the sentiment overwhelming.
The editorial boldly supported the headlines:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“... enough of this policy of negation.
If national pride has not
been sufficient to prompt the United
States to activity, to its rôle as a
leader among the powers, surely the
goad of a violated neutrality and an
utter disregard of international law
should be sufficient to open the eyes
of its people....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">“The refusal to exercise intervention
was natural. The refusal to
make the first move in calling a congress
of all nations including the belligerents,
was hardly less so. We
should in no wise assume to dictate to
the powers of Europe. The refusal
to mobilize the army or to begin to
provide anything like adequate coast
defences a people has borne patiently
and far too long. But the tacit refusal
to permit the citizens to bear
arms in defence of this their land ...
etc.”</p>

<p class="p1">The Inger slapped the paper and the page
slit down its length.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” he said, “they’ve got it. Ain’t it
a wonder,” he put it to the flying Pennsylvania
landscape, “that I come just when I come?”</p>

<p>The graciousness and quiet of Washington,
the spaciousness of the vast white station, the
breadth and leisure of the streets, welcomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
them like a presence. Here was something
such as they had left at home&mdash;a sense of the
ample.</p>

<p>“Seems like there was room enough for
two more here,” said the Inger contentedly,
as they turned into the avenue.</p>

<p>They chose to walk to find Lory’s aunt,
lured by the large village aspect of the place.
And as they walked, there leaped up for them
from the roofs the insistent, dominant shaft
of the monument.</p>

<p>“Thanks be,” said the Inger. “There’s
somethin’ to shin up. It begun to look to
me like the East is a place where all the trails
laid flat.”</p>

<p>“I kind of like it here, though,” Lory said
apologetically.</p>

<p>“Seems like there’s more folks and their
stuff, and less of God and his stuff,” the Inger
offered after a pause.</p>

<p>Lory shook her head. Her hair was in
disorder, and the soot of the train filmed her
face, but her look was strangely radiant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“I donno. I feel like there was lots of
God around,” she said.</p>

<p>She had waked the previous morning in the
dimness of the coach and had found her head
on his shoulder, his cheek on her hair, her
hand in his hand. For a moment she lay
still, remembering. Then she lifted her face
slowly, lest she should waken him. But he
was awake and smiled down at her, without
moving, save that his clasp a little tightened.
She struggled up, her flushed face still near
his.</p>

<p>“Your arm,” she said; “ain’t it near dead?”</p>

<p>He sat quietly, and still smiling. “I give
you my word,” he said, “I ain’t once thought
of myself in connection with that arm’s
dyin’.”</p>

<p>“Did you sleep?” she demanded, anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” he said ruefully, “I did&mdash;some.”</p>

<p>Having thought of him, she began to think
of herself. She sat erect, her hands busy at
her hair, her face crimson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell me something,” he said, and when she
looked round at him: “did you care?”</p>

<p>“Did I care&mdash;what?” she asked.</p>

<p>He kept her eyes. “Did you?” he repeated.</p>

<p>“I care about bein’ a whole lot of bother to
you,” she answered gravely. “An’ I’m goin’
to pay for my own breakfast.”</p>

<p>They breakfasted for the first time in the
dining-car&mdash;both infinitely ill at ease, Lory
confusedly ordering the first things on the
card, the Inger indolently demanding flapjacks
and bacon. And when they brought
the bacon dry, he repudiated it, and asked
gently if they thought he didn’t know how it
was cooked or what?&mdash;ultimately securing,
with the interested participation of the steward,
a swimming dish of gravy. After that,
Lory had slipped in a vacant seat on the other
side of the car, and he had gone back to their
own seat, and stared miserably out the window.
He ought, he reflected, to have been
showing her at every step of the way that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
despised himself; and here instead he had
made her ill at ease with him, afraid of him,
eager to be away from him. That night, in the
long dragging journey of their slow train, they
had sat apart, as they had sat on the Overland.</p>

<p>Here on the avenue in Washington, she was
merely disregarding him. For the first time
in their days together, she seemed to be
almost happy. That, he settled the matter,
was because she was so soon to be free of him.
There came upon him, for the hundredth time,
the memory of her reason for coming to him
in her need&mdash;</p>

<p>“I didn’t know no woman I could tell&mdash;nor
no other decent man.”</p>

<p>It was the supreme compliment of his life&mdash;it
was his justification. And how had he
rewarded it....</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt her hand on his arm, and
when he turned, she was looking away and
before them. He followed her eyes and saw
the white dome.</p>

<p>“It’s it,” she said, reverently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “It’s it, sure enough.”</p>

<p>They walked on, staring at it. All that
could be in the heart of a people all the time
was in their faces for the meaning of it.</p>

<p>In a little back street, ugly save for its
abundant shade, they came to the home of
Lory’s aunt. It was a chubby house, with
bright eyes, and the possibilities, never developed,
of a smile. There were a small,
smothered yard, and an over-ripe fence, and
the evidences of complete discouragement on
the part of the house to distinguish itself from
its neighbors, all made in the same mint.</p>

<p>A woman with an absorbed look answered
the door; when she saw them, she slightly
opened her mouth, but the absorbed look did
not leave her eyes.</p>

<p>“For evermore,” she said. “It’s Lory
Moor. And I ain’t a thing in the house to
eat.”</p>

<p>The girl kissed her, and the woman suffered
it, not without interest, but still in that other
absorption, and led them into the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“How’d you ever come to come?” she said.
“I <i>have</i> got some fresh baked bread, if that’ll
do you.”</p>

<p>And at Lory’s protest,</p>

<p>“This your husband?” her aunt asked.
“Well, I’ll tell you what, we can send <i>him</i>
to the bakery.”</p>

<p>With this the Inger took matters in his
own hands. There was something epic in his
description.</p>

<p>“Miss Moor’s husband that was going to
be,” he said, “is Mr. Bunchy Haight, a saloon
keeper in Inch. She’s run away from him on
her weddin’ night. And I’ve brought her to
you. Wasn’t that right?”</p>

<p>“My gracious,” said her aunt.</p>

<p>“It’s just till I get a job,” Lory put in.
“Was I right to come, Aunt ’Cretia?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course so, of course so,” said her
aunt. “Jem Moor always was a weak fool.
Can you make biscuits?”</p>

<p>Lory nodded.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have biscuits and honey for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
supper,” she arranged it, and the principal
thing settled: “How <i>is</i> Jem?” she said, and
then took account of her niece’s presence with
“How you have grown!”</p>

<p>In a little while they went out to the kitchen.
And there the plump complacence of the little
house gave way, and they stood facing its
tragedy. As they entered, a chain rattled and
drew across the zinc under the cooking-stove.
An old man got to his feet, and one of his legs
was chained to the leg of the wooden settle.
He must have been eighty. His gray beard
half covered his face. He stood with his head
forward, and watched them immovably.</p>

<p>“It’s Hiram’s father,” said Aunt ’Cretia
parenthetically. “We’ve kep’ him chained in
the kitchen ’most a year now. His head ain’t
right.”</p>

<p>The Inger went over to him, seized by a
horror and a pity which shook him, and he
stood with this leaping pity in his face. On a
sudden impulse he put out his hand to the old
man, with a groping sense that here was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
language which the maddest could comprehend.</p>

<p>To his amazement, the old man jumped
backward, his chain dragging and rattling on
the floor. From his throat there came a
sound, three times repeated, like a guttural
giving forth of breath. Then slowly his lips
drew back until they showed his toothless
gums, where might have been fangs. He
crouched and watched.</p>

<p>They stood so for a moment, looking at
each other. Then the Inger wheeled and
strode to the door, and went out in the little
kitchen garden. Late sunlight slanted here,
swallows were wheeling and twittering, and
a comfortable cat was delicately walking a
fence.</p>

<p>The man stood, feeling a sudden physical
nausea. Something not in human happenings
had happened. He felt as if he could never
go into that room again. He sat down on the
clothes reel. He had felt friendliness, and
the old man had wanted to spring at him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
It was monstrous, incredible. He found himself
trying to make in his throat the sound that
the old man had made.</p>

<p>He sat there until Lory came to the door to
tell him that supper was ready. She was in
a clean print gown, from her pack. She
stood beside him, smiling, and telling him that
the biscuits were hot and that her uncle had
come. The gown, her smile, what she was
saying, all brought him back, grateful, to
the commonplace hour. He followed her,
and spoke fearfully.</p>

<p>“Do we eat in the kitchen, do you know?”
he asked.</p>

<p>To her negative he made no comment, and
went with her through the kitchen, but he
could not keep from looking. The old man
sat on the settle, his eyes immovably fixed
on them. “If I try to touch him, he’ll
snarl,” the Inger thought. “He’ll <i>snarl</i>.”</p>

<p>Lory’s uncle, Hiram Folts, a petty clerk
in one of the departments, was plainly
staggered by this advent into his household,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and plied his guests with questions. He was
a thick, knotted man, who walked as if his
feet hurt, and continually fumbled with blunt
finger tips at his shaven jaw.</p>

<p>“I was saying to her yesterday, or Tuesday,&mdash;or
was it Monday?&mdash;that she hadn’t
heard from you folks in a long while,” he said.</p>

<p>The talk, the food, the motley dishes,
the wall-paper and the colored pictures were
the American middle-class home at its dreariest.
But there was cheer and there was
welcome, and the kindly hearts were potentialities
of what might be in human relationship.
Through the hour, came the dragging
and the rattling of the old man’s chain on
the zinc, and once a fretful, tired whining.</p>

<p>“Be good, pa!” Hiram Folts called, gently,
and the whining ceased.</p>

<p>By some fortune, he had a meeting which
took him early, leaving the household rocking
with his hunt for a properly ironed collar.
Lory electing to rest, the Inger set forth with
his host, and left him as soon as he could, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the promise to be his guest for that night.
This little man was one whom, in a saloon in
Inch, the Inger would unmercifully have bedevilled.
But sitting at his table, he had
taken him at another value, and later had
insisted hotly on paying his car fare.</p>

<p>Once alone down town in that city, the
Inger walked with head erect, his eyes on the
façades of buildings, on the lights, on all the
aspects of a city street to which the habitués
grow accustomed. This was, for the world
of a city, the most beautiful world which he
had ever walked. He knew not at all what
it was that pleased him. But the order and
smoothness of the streets, the leisure or pleasant
absorption of the passers, the abundant
light, the dignity of the stone, all these met
him with another contact than that of muddy,
roystering Inch, or the shining body of San Francisco,
or the sullen, struggling soul of Chicago.</p>

<p>“A fellow must have a nerve to get drunk
here,” was the way that he thought all this.</p>

<p>Before the office of <i>The Post</i> he halted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
crossed. A lit bulletin board had called a
crowd:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“President Receives Telegrams
from Eighteen Mass Meetings Demanding
War.”</p>

<p class="pn1">he read.</p>

<p>A rough voice cried out:</p>

<p>“Yes, and if there’d been anybody home in
Washington, we’d had a meeting here!”</p>

<p>No one made any comment, and the man disappeared
in the crowd.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Ten Thousand Cut to Pieces in
the Stelvio Pass.”</p>

<p class="pn1">the bulletin went on.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“‘End of the War Not in Sight’
Lord of Admiralty says.</p>

<p class="pbq">“Two Thousand Women March
Sixty Miles in the Snow with Their
Children.</p>

<p class="pbq">“Seven Women Travel Together
to Washington from Seven Warring
Nations.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The Inger went on down the street. The
bulletin board was like a window opened
abruptly upon another world, and closed
again. Again the quiet and soft brilliance of
Pennsylvania Avenue came to meet him.
He turned and looked back at that dim,
watchful dome.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ to stir a man up to enlist here,”
he thought. “This town looks like the war’d
been put to bed.”</p>

<p>He looked in at the door of the New Willard,
saw the lobby and the corridor unaccountably
filled with women, and retreated. On the
street he looked down at himself in slow
speculation.</p>

<p>“I donno but what I’d look better in
some differ’nt clothes,” he thought, in surprise.</p>

<p>When he returned to the house, Lory had
gone to bed, and he felt a vague disappointment.
He had wanted to tell her about it.
Yet, in the morning, when he tried to tell
her, all that he found to say was:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s a nice, neat town. Everybody minds
their own business. I tell you, a fellow’d
have his nerve to get drunk here.”</p>

<p>Against her aunt’s will, Lory was to begin
her search for work that day. There
were virtually no advertisements for help.
She started early to find an employment
agency. The Inger went with her, and when
they were alone in the street, she turned to
him.</p>

<p>“Don’t you leave me keep you here a
minute,” she said earnestly. “You go when
you’re ready&mdash;you know that.”</p>

<p>“Go where?” he said. “Where’ll I go?”</p>

<p>“Where you want to,” she answered. “I
mean&mdash;I’ve hung on to you long enough.”</p>

<p>“You want me to go, don’t you?” he said.
“Well&mdash;I should think you would.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to drag on you&mdash;and spend
your money,” she answered. “As soon as I
can, I’ll pay you for my ticket&mdash;you know
that&mdash;”</p>

<p>She stopped, suddenly breathless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh,” she said, “I ain’t goin’ to try to tell
you all you done for me. I guess you know
that!”</p>

<p>“You look a-here,” he said, “I’m goin’ to
sit by till I see you get some kind of a job&mdash;if
a job’s what you want. Oh, don’t be
afraid I’ll bother you. I’ll get a room somewheres&mdash;and
keep track. And don’t you
be afraid I’ll do much&mdash;not <i>much</i>&mdash;that I
don’t want to do.”</p>

<p>They went to one or two of the agencies,
and the Inger waited on the curb till she
reappeared&mdash;sometimes after an hour of
his waiting. And once as they went through
a downtown street, he spoke in wonder:</p>

<p>“I never saw so many women in a place
in my life,” he said. “Not even in Inch, in
race track times. Did you notice?”</p>

<p>Lory sighed. “Yes,” she said, “I did.
How do you s’pose they all got so much
to see about, and such a lot o’ nice clothes?”
she asked.</p>

<p>The day passed fruitlessly for her. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Inger found a room, which he rented without
looking at it, and came back to the Folts’s for
his things. Mrs. Folts insisted that he stay
for supper, and when he had accepted he was
aghast to find that, the evening being chilly,
and Mr. Folts being kept late at the department
that night, they were to sit at supper
in the kitchen.</p>

<p>The old man on the settle was very quiet.
He sat crouched in a corner, and save for
those immovable eyes on them all, his presence
would hardly have been noticed. The
Inger had brought an evening paper, and
occasionally he read from it snatches of the
European news, but principally to keep his
eyes from the old man.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Ranks to be thrown open without
age limit.”</p>

<p class="pn1">he read.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Rumored that young boys and
old men will be drafted within a
month.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">“There, pa, who says that ain’t <i>your</i>
chance?” Mrs. Folts put in.</p>

<p>The old man lifted his head, and listened.</p>

<p>“War may drag on for another year,” the
Inger continued, and the old man broke out
with that sharp labored outpouring of guttural
breath&mdash;once, twice, three times.</p>

<p>“War!” he said. “War. War. Who
says I can go? Who says....”</p>

<p>He forgot what he had been saying, and
searched for it piteously. He sprang up, and
paced the four steps each way that his chain
allowed him.</p>

<p>“There, there, pa! I’ll come feed you
your supper now,” Mrs. Folts soothed him.</p>

<p>But while she fed him, she was called away
to the door, and thrust the dish into Lory’s
hand, and went. The old man, seeing the
dish recede, burst into savage grunting. The
Inger took the plate from Lory, and sat
beside him on the settle.</p>

<p>The old man ate&mdash;the Inger never forgot
how. With his eyes immovably fixed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Inger’s face, he crept cautiously forward to
meet the spoon, and when he had the contents
safe, drew back like a dog to his corner,
with those strange grunting breaths.</p>

<p>“Poor old fellow!” the Inger tried to say,
softly&mdash;and the grunting mounted to a
snarl.</p>

<p>When they had fed him, the Inger drew
Lory out into the quiet of the little garden.</p>

<p>“You can’t stand that,” he said. “I
won’t have you stand that. You’ve got to
get some place an’ get out o’ this.”</p>

<p>She looked down the dusk of the garden,
and he was surprised to see that she was
smiling a little.</p>

<p>“You don’t know,” she said. “With that&mdash;or
hard work&mdash;or anything else&mdash;I’ll always
think it’s heaven to what I thought had to
happen.”</p>

<p>“You mean Inch?” he comprehended.</p>

<p>“I mean Bunchy,” she said.</p>

<p>She moved down the path, and following
her for a step or two, he noted the dress she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
was wearing, and the tan of her neck, and her
arms in their thin sleeves.</p>

<p>“That’s the dress you had on that day in
the desert,” he said suddenly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered. “It’s almost the
only dress I’ve got,” she added.</p>

<p>He fell to wondering whether it would
be possible for her ever to forgive him
now, and come to him, and whether it
could ever be as it might have been.
Sometime, perhaps, when he came back
from the war&mdash;if he came.... It was
on his lips to make her know. But always
the memory of the night on the
trail swept him. “I didn’t know no woman
I could tell&mdash;nor no other decent man.”
And then....</p>

<p>She stood still, looking back at the house.</p>

<p>“I wanted,” she said, “to get that newspaper.
Did you see what it said about
women&mdash;about who’s here?”</p>

<p>He had not seen, but he would not let her
go back to the kitchen, nor would he go himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
They went round the house, and found
a newsstand, and sat over a little table in an
ice-cream place.</p>

<p>“Many Women Arrive in Capital,” the
headlines said. “Large Number of Women
Arrivals at Hotels. Conjecture Washington
May Become Shopping Centre of the East.”</p>

<p>“We noticed this morning&mdash;we said so
this morning,” Lory remembered.</p>

<p>“I guess it just happened so,” the Inger
said. “You’ve all come buying good clothes,
I bet.”</p>

<p>She did not smile, but sat looking across the
room. The wife of the soda fountain man
and two women from outside leaned there,
talking.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be funny,” Lory said, “if the
women all come here the way I come&mdash;unexpected?”</p>

<p>He did not hear her. He was reading
eagerly down the first column of the page:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Answer Still Delayed. President
Not Yet Ready to Give Out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Statement. Mass Meeting Resolutions
produce Profound Effect. Foreign
Pressure Increasing. All-Night
Cabinet Meeting Likely&mdash;”</p>

<p class="p1">“Lord Heavens,” cried the Inger, “why
don’t they light in an’ smash ’em&mdash;like
<i>men</i>?”</p>

<p>She did not hear him. The three women
in the corner were looking at her curiously,
and she wondered why. As she walked by
them toward the door, she thought that she
heard one of them whisper:</p>

<p>“She don’t know!”</p>

<p>When she reached the door, she turned
back and looked at them.</p>

<p>“Do you live near?” the proprietor’s wife
asked her.</p>

<p>“Just since to-day,” the girl said. “I just
come&mdash;from California.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” the woman comprehended. “Come
in again&mdash;soon.” And something else she
added that sounded like “To-morrow&mdash;maybe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Lory nodded and they went out.</p>

<p>“The whole place seems to be waitin’ for
somethin’,” the Inger was saying. “Why
don’t they jump in&mdash;why don’t they jump
in?”</p>

<p>The girl was not listening. She was looking
at the groups of women in the doorways.</p>

<p>The two walked back to the chubby
house. It was frowning, for there were no
lights in its windows, save a glimmer
from the kitchen where the gas jet always
burned.</p>

<p>“Not out there,” said the Inger, as they
went in the dark passage. “Don’t let’s go
where the old man is.”</p>

<p>“I can hear talking,” Lory said only, and
threw open the kitchen door.</p>

<p>The supper table was still covered, with
its litter of dishes. On the settle the old
man was lying, with his head lifted, watching.
Beside the stove sat the Inger’s father and
Bunchy Haight. No one else was in the
room.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">VIII</h2>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> Inger stepped in front of Lory, and,
before the others turned, wheeled to face
her.</p>

<p>“Go get your aunt here,” he said, under
his voice, and, as she retreated, closed the
passage door upon her. Then he turned to
the room.</p>

<p>“Well, Dad!” he cried. “Well, Bunchy!
Better have another stick or two on the fire,
hadn’t we?” he offered.</p>

<p>While the Inger followed his own suggestion,
Bunchy watched him, lowering. But
the Inger’s father began to talk.</p>

<p>“Bunchy was comin’ along here&mdash;he was
comin’ along,” he explained, “so I thought
I’d come along too. I thought I better
come along too&mdash;”</p>

<p>His son glanced at him keenly, wondering
at his uncertain manner. As the stove door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
closed, the Inger inquired with perfect interest:</p>

<p>“How’d you find the place&mdash;go to
Chicago?”</p>

<p>“Yes, damn you,” said Bunchy, suddenly,
and rose, and without warning threw himself
upon the Inger.</p>

<p>It took longer than one would have thought,
for though the Inger was physically fit and
Bunchy was flabby and overfed, he had the
strength of blind anger. It cost a distinct
effort for the Inger to throw him. He went
down with his head on the zinc, and the
Inger, with his knee on his chest and his hand
on his throat, took breath and regarded him.
Bunchy’s little eyes looked up at him like the
eyes of a trapped wolf. His thick, raw lips
were working.</p>

<p>A profound, ungoverned sense of hatred
and loathing filled the Inger. Here was a
creature, vile and sordid, to whom Lory
Moor was to have been given over, and who
was come now seeking his prey. He seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
unspeakable, he seemed, by all the decencies, a
thing of which to rid the earth. The Inger
shrank from his contact with him, from his
hand on that smooth, puffy throat. He felt
for him all the “just” horror of which he was
capable, and, superadded, an intense physical
abomination. All this swept him and possessed
him and emptied him of every other
feeling.</p>

<p>Then the Inger became conscious that
above the sound of their shuffling and breathing,
another sound had been growing which
now filled the room. It was a dreadful,
guttural breathing, unlike that of a man in
strife, but rather like that of an animal at
its feeding.</p>

<p>The Inger threw up his head and looked.
Close by his shoulder, as he knelt there beside
the cooking-range, the madman was
leaning, watching. Only now, instead of the
immovable eyes, his were eyes which blazed
and gleamed with a look unimaginable. And
the sound that filled the room was the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
man’s guttural breath, and with every breath,
words, half articulate, were mingled:</p>

<p>“Kill ’im. Kill ’im. Kill ’im. Kill ’im,”
he was saying. That was all&mdash;the words
did not vary, nor the ghastly tone, nor the
dreadful breathing. “Kill ’im. Kill ’im.
Kill ’im.”</p>

<p>His long, freckled hands were outspread
and trembling. His back was crooked and
his head thrust forward. His hair fell about
his face. He stepped here and there, as he
could, his leg chain clanking. And he said
over his fearful chant, like an invocation to
some devil.</p>

<p>And the Inger, who was feeling the same
rage, looked in the old madman’s eyes, and
the two understood each other.</p>

<p>All the horror which the sane man had felt
at the beast in the other, stared from the
Inger’s eyes, as he looked. And abruptly he
was wrenched with horror of the beast in himself.
With a sense of weakness, as at the going
out of something which seemed to drain his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
veins, to abandon his body like a great breath
from his pores, he took his eyes away from that
face.</p>

<p>He relaxed his hold on Bunchy and rose.</p>

<p>“Get up,” he said to him, and looked away
from him.</p>

<p>Bunchy scrambled to his feet, amazed,
blinking, pulling at his collar, casting sidewise
glances of vehement suspicion. The Inger
merely stood there, not looking at him.</p>

<p>“Listen here,” said the Inger, in a moment.
“The girl is here with her folks. If ever the
time comes when she’ll marry me, God knows
I want her. But for now, I’m out of your
way. You can deal with her and her folks,
for all of me. Understand?”</p>

<p>Considering the Inger’s obvious advantage,
Bunchy by no means understood. His look
said so. Neither was the Inger’s father at
all comprehending. In his father’s face the
genial kindness and the settled sadness had
given place to a contagion of rage and passion.
The Inger had never seen his father like this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Even in that moment, this look on the kind,
careless face filled the son with sick surprise.
The old man by the settle, who had stood
staring at this strange turn of things, broke
into a plaintive whimper.</p>

<p>“Kill ’im&mdash;kill ’im&mdash;kill ’im ...,” he
besought, like a disappointed, teasing child.</p>

<p>When Bunchy would have spoken, spluttering,
he was arrested by a sound at the door.
It was Lory and her aunt, whom she had found
in talk with women at a neighbor’s; and it was
Hiram Folts, whom, returning, they had met
at the street door. The Inger greeted them
gravely.</p>

<p>“You meet my father,” he said, and named
them. “And you meet,” he said, “Mr.
Bunchy Haight.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Folts stared. Not one of all her gifts
was a gift for diplomacy.</p>

<p>“Why, ain’t that the man&mdash;ain’t that the
name&mdash;” she recalled it, and met the Inger’s
nod, and saw the look on Lory’s face, and
instantly reacted in her own way. “My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
gracious,” she said, “<i>have</i> you had your
suppers?”</p>

<p>Bunchy, replying with labored elegance,
fain to be his gallant best to Lory’s aunt, fain
to look beseechingly and reproachfully at
Lory, and fain to glower heartily at his
enemy, became a writhing Bunchy, demeaning
himself with ample absurdity.</p>

<p>The Inger was merely silent. In a moment,
he took his leave and, as he went, he turned
to Lory.</p>

<p>“If you want me,” he said, “send for me.
I’ll be waitin’ there in the room I got.”</p>

<p>She made no answer. She had been like
some one stricken since first she had seen who
was in the room.</p>

<p>“You’ll do it?” he persisted, grateful for
Hiram Folt’s nervous fire of questions at his
new guest.</p>

<p>She met his eyes and, for an instant, it
seemed to him that she gave him her eyes, as
she had done that morning on the desert.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “I’ll do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>The last sound that he heard as he went
down the passage with his father was the
fretful whining of the madman:</p>

<p>“Kill ’im&mdash;kill ’im&mdash;kill ’im....”</p>

<p>Out on the street the Inger looked at the
stretch of asphalt pavement, the even fronts
of the houses, the lights set a certain space
apart, and he looked in the faces of men and
women walking home with parcels. All these
were so methodical and quiet that they made
it seem impossible that he had just wanted to
kill a man. All this scene was arranged and
ordered, and what he had done had been&mdash;disorderly.
He thought of the word as he had
often seen it in the Inch <i>Weekly</i>: “arrested
for being disorderly.” That was it, of course;
and here the buildings were as they had been
appointed, and the lights were set a certain
space apart.... But he had not killed the
man! And he was doing the way all the
others were doing. He and his father were
walking here, like all the others. This
seemed wonderful. He looked at the lights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and at the buildings as if he understood
them.</p>

<p>He noticed that his father was trembling.
At a crosswalk he caught gropingly at his
son’s arm.</p>

<p>“We’ll have some victuals,” said the Inger,
and led him to a little restaurant. His father
followed obediently; but the food they set
before him remained untouched. He sat there
weakly, drank cold water, and assented eagerly
when the Inger suggested that he go to bed.</p>

<p>In the Inger’s little room he sank on the
edge of the single bed, and the Inger was unspeakably
shocked to see him cry.</p>

<p>“What, Dad?” he could only say over
uncomfortably. “What?”</p>

<p>“I wish’t I could ’a’ settled with him,” his
father said. “I wish’t I could ’a’ settled <i>one</i>
varmint before I die.”</p>

<p>“What’d you want to muss with him for?”
he inquired impatiently.</p>

<p>“Because I ain’t never done much of anything
that was much of anything,” the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
man said. He straightened himself. “An’
I could of did this!” he added with abrupt
energy.</p>

<p>The Inger studied him intently. The great
rugged bones of the older man and the big,
thick, ineffectual hands suddenly spoke to
him, out of the deep of this undirected life.
They had wanted to act&mdash;those bones and
those hands!</p>

<p>“He wasn’t worth the powder,” the Inger
said, but he was not thinking of what he said.
He was staring at the tears rolling down the
old man’s face. “Get to bed&mdash;get to bed,
Dad,” he kept insisting.</p>

<p>But first his father would tell him, in fragments,
disjointed, pieced together by the
Inger’s guesses, how his presence there had
come about.</p>

<p>Before daylight on the night of the Inger’s
departure, his father had been roused by
Bunchy and two of his friends arriving at the
hut. Questioned, the old man had had
nothing to tell them. His son had gone to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
wedding, that was all he knew. Still, his
son was unmistakably missing now, and the
absence was the clue on which Bunchy had
worked all that day. On the morning of the
second day, the messenger had come riding
over from the ticket agent beyond Whiteface,
and had spread in the bars of Inch the tale of
the manner of the Inger’s purchase of two
tickets to Chicago. As soon as he heard, the
old man, having done his son’s bidding at the
bank in Inch, had sought out Bunchy, found
him leaving on the Limited, and abruptly
resolved to travel with him&mdash;“So’s to keep
my eye on the bugger,” he said. Here he
began to retell it all, and to fit, in wrong
places, some account of Bunchy’s doings on
the journey and of their half day in Chicago.
“He’s a bugger&mdash;a bad bugger,” the old
man repeated fretfully, “only he’s worse’n
that, if I could think....”</p>

<p>By all this and by the nerveless movements
and the obvious weakness of his father, a fact
gradually returned to the Inger:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dad!” he cried. “You said you was sick
the night you come to the hut. Ain’t that
over?”</p>

<p>It appeared that it was by no means “over”&mdash;the
sickness of which the older man had
complained. To the Inger, sickness meant
so little in experience that he was unable to
take it seriously in any one else. In all
these days, he had not once recalled his
father’s mention that he was ailing. He
was swept by his compunction. Against the
old man’s protest, he called a doctor. And
the doctor, after his examination, left what
he could, and, when the Inger emphatically
refused to have a nurse sent, unexpectedly
announced that he would look in again
toward morning.</p>

<p>When, almost at once, his father had fallen
asleep in the little single bed, the Inger
turned out the light, drew the shade to the
top of the window, and stood staring across
the roofs. Against the sky rose the dome of
the Capitol, pricked with a thousand lights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>He breathed deep, and abruptly he understood
that here in the darkness, alone, he was
feeling an elation which was to him unaccountable.
Something tremendous seemed to
have happened to him. What was it? He
did not know. His father was ill&mdash;Bunchy
was here&mdash;Lory Moor was in trouble&mdash;he
was haunted by the image of that mad old
man. And yet his whole being was pervaded
by a sense of lightness, of gratification,
of sheer energy such as he never had known.
For an hour he stood there, and he could not
have told what he had been thinking. Only
something unspeakable seemed to have occurred,
which kept him from sleep.</p>

<p>He did sleep at last, rolled in his blanket
and lying on the floor. But he was awake,
and had ministered to his father, and below,
on the doorstep, stood stretching prodigiously,
when in the crisp morning, the doctor
came back. As the doctor left, he drew the
Inger down the stairs again. They spoke
together in the little passage, in the light that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
came through the orange glass over the door.
His father had, by a miracle, lived to reach
him. Any hour of that day might be his
last hour.</p>

<p>The Inger went back upstairs, and stared
at his father. Impossible. He had been
living for so long. There was so much that
he himself remembered having been told of
this man’s youth and young manhood. It
was incredible that now he should die, and
no one would remember these things any
more.... There had been one story about
his buying an eagle somewhere, and setting
it free. The Inger had always liked to hear
that story. Now it would close over, and no
one else would know. This alone seemed
intolerable.</p>

<p>He went downstairs, and out on the street.
At the next house a blind man lived. This
man took his little walk every day. The
walk consisted of six paces from the house to
the street, and six paces back again. On the
street he dared not go. Here in the yard he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
could encounter nothing. To guide his course
he dragged his stick on the edge of the bricks.
In this way he could walk very briskly, almost
as a man might walk on a street. The
Inger watched him. Something in himself
seemed to go out of him and to make its way
to that blind man.</p>

<p>“Sometime,” he thought, “I’ll go and take
him for a walk&mdash;afterward.”</p>

<p>That day all Washington, and with it all
the country, stood on its doorstep, awaiting
the newspapers. But when the boys first
came crying the headlines, the Inger let them
go by. He had a vague sense of wishing not
to be interrupted. Toward noon, however,
a phrase caught from a street call lured him
down. One of the newspapers which batten
on bad news, playing it up, making it worse,
contradicting it for another price, came to his
hand. This paper announced that the United
States would that day positively declare war
on the offending nation. Even then the newspaper’s
presses were methodically at work on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
a denial, but this the Inger did not know.
He sat staring at what he read. So, then, it
had come. So, then, he was really to go to
war.... There was something, too, about
a great meeting of women in the Capitol.
To this, save the headlines and the snapshots
of women which covered an inside page, he
did not attend. “Sob Session Probable,”
he read, and wondered what it meant.</p>

<p>His father still slept, and, watching by his
bed, he himself grew drowsy. He lay down on
his blanket on the floor. This was a strange
thing, to lie down to sleep in the day time.
He looked up at the high walls of his tiny room.
The side walls were larger than the floor&mdash;as
the walls of a grave would be&mdash;he thought.
His father stirred and whimpered.</p>

<p>“Oh my God&mdash;my God&mdash;my God....”
he said, but he did not wake. This he said
over many times.</p>

<p>At last the Inger dozed, with a preliminary
sense of sinking, and of struggling not to let
himself go. In his dream he went with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
father on an immense empty field. There
they were looking for the others, and they
could see no one. They walked for a long
way, looking for the others. Then these
others were all about them, and they were
marching, and it seemed very natural that
there should be war. At any moment now,
there would be war. So they marched and
stood face to face with those whom they were
sent to fight. And a sense of sickening
horror shook him in his dream&mdash;for those
whom they faced were women. The women
were coming, and they had only their bare
hands. Tossed by a tide of ancestral fear, he
understood that among those women was
Lory Moor. He shouted to her to go away&mdash;but
instead they all came on, steadily, all
those women&mdash;and he could not tell where
she walked, and every one said that the orders
were to fire. Caught and wrenched by the
fear that never lives, any more, among waking
men, he lived the dead passion of fear in his
sleep, and woke, wasted by his horror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>He struggled up and looked at his father.</p>

<p>“Oh my God ... my God ... my God,”
his weak voice was going on.</p>

<p>And from the floor beside him the black
headlines of the lying paper stared:</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">“U. S. To Declare War To-Day.”</p>

<p class="p1">The Inger slept again, and this time the
clamor and crashing of the thing were
upon him. This now was war&mdash;but not
as he had imagined it. He was in no excitement,
no enthusiasm, even no horror.
He was merely looking for a chance to kill&mdash;keenly,
methodically, looking for a chance to
kill. In the ranks beside him was that old
madman from the kitchen&mdash;but there was no
time even to think of this. They were all
very busy. Then it grew dark, and the field
went swimming out in stars, and many voices
came calling and these met where he was:</p>

<p>“God&mdash;God&mdash;they’ve killed God....”
the voices cried.</p>

<p>Again the nameless terror shook him. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
if <i>he</i> had been the one to kill God? He
sought wildly among piles of the dead to find
God, and he was not found. Then many
came and touched him and stared in his face,
and he understood them. God had not been
killed at all. <i>He himself was God and he had
been killing men....</i></p>

<p>At this the terror that was on him was like
nothing that he had ever known. It took
him and tore him, and he writhed under a
nameless sense of the irreparable, which ate
at him, living. When he awoke, he lay
weakly grateful that the thing was not true.
Something swam through his head, and he
tried to capture it&mdash;was it true? Was he
God? He struggled up and sat with his
head in his hands. There were things that
he wanted to think, if he had known how to
think then.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when the end
came to his father, quietly, and with no pain.
His father knew him, smiled at him, and with
perfect gentleness and without shyness, put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
out his hand. Save in a handshake, he had
never taken his hand before since he was a
little boy. But now they took each other’s
hands naturally, as if a veil had gone. Afterward,
the Inger wondered why he had not
kissed him. He had not thought of that.</p>

<p>Before he called any one, the Inger stood
still, looking at his father, and looking out the
window to the City. So much had happened.
A great deal of what had happened he understood,
but there was much more that
seemed to be pressing on him to be made
clear. He had a strong sense of being some
one else, of standing outside and watching.
What great change was this that had come
to his father and to him?</p>

<p>By dark they had taken his father away.
The Inger went with him and did what he
could. His father lay in an undertaker’s
chapel. From the street the Inger stared at
the chapel. It looked so strangely like the
other buildings.</p>

<p>He took back to his room some poor belongings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of his father’s, and when he saw the
little room, and the empty unmade bed, he
was shaken by a draining sense of loneliness&mdash;the
first loneliness that he had ever known.
Then he let his thought go where all day it
had longed to go. He wanted Lory Moor.</p>

<p>He let himself go round by the little house
of the Folts’s. It was quite dark, save for that
watching light in the kitchen window. He
waited on the other side of the street for a
long time. No one came. There seemed to
be no one in the neighborhood. A little dog
came by, looked up at him, and stood wagging
a ragged tail. The Inger stooped, then
squatted beside the dog, and patted his head.</p>

<p>“I must get a dog,” he thought. “I’d
ought to have a dog.”</p>

<p>At last he went away, down toward the
town. And as he went, darkness seemed to
close in and press about him. His hands
were empty. His life was something other
than that which he had believed it to be.
Where was all this that he had had....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">IX</h2>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">As</span> he turned into a wider street, he became
aware that he was following with many who
went one way. He kept on with them,
intent on nothing. On Pennsylvania Avenue
the crowd was going east, and he went east.
But of all this he thought little, until he came
near the Capitol. There the people swung
both east and west, and rounded the building.
So he came out in the Square before the east
entrance.</p>

<p>The Square was filled with women. There
were some men, too, but women were dominant
in the throng. He remembered the
meeting to which the papers had vaguely
referred and because he had nothing to do,
he moved on with the rest to the doors.</p>

<p>He noted that the women were saying
little. It was almost a silent throng, as if all
were immeasurably absorbed in something.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Oddly, he thought of Mrs. Folts, and her
absorption in food for her family and her
guests.</p>

<p>He was in time to find room on the steps
and then within the rotunda. He stared
about him. This looked different from all
other buildings that he had seen&mdash;as if
great things were due to happen here. He
pressed on slowly, as the others pressed.
Eventually the elevators received them, and
he found himself in an enormous room, the
seats of the floor already filled, the galleries
fast filling. He stood against the wall and
looked. Below and above a throng of women,
and only here and there a man. It occurred
to him at last that he did not belong here, but
now he could not well retreat, for the crowd
blocked the doors.</p>

<p>On the platform were a dozen women. He
looked at them curiously. He was familiar
with but one sort of woman who was willing
to show herself before a crowd. There flashed
to his mind the memory of the dozen women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
whom he had seen on the stage of the Mission
Saloon in Inch, on what was to have been
Bunchy’s wedding night. Dress them like
this, he reflected&mdash;dark and plain&mdash;and
they wouldn’t look so different, at this
distance.</p>

<p>The silence disturbed him. What on earth
made them so still&mdash;as if it were a matter of
life and death, whatever they were meeting
about. He waited in absorbing curiosity to
hear what it was they were going to say.</p>

<p>“Somebody says the Senate’s full, too,” he
heard a man tell some one. “And they’re
going to speak in the rotunda and on the
steps.”</p>

<p>The Inger turned to him.</p>

<p>“What’s this room?” he asked.</p>

<p>“This is the House,” the man replied,
courteously.</p>

<p>The Inger looked with new eyes. The
House ... where his laws were made. He
felt a sudden surprised sense of pride in the
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>The silence became a hush, contagious, electric,
and he saw that a woman on the platform
had risen. She stood hatless, her hair
brushed smoothly back, and her hands behind
her. Abruptly he liked her. And he
wondered what his mother had looked like.</p>

<p>There was no applause, but to his amazement
the whole audience rose, and stood for
a moment, in absolute silence. This woman
spoke simply, and as if she were talking to
each one there. It astonished the man. He
had heard no one address a meeting save in
campaign speeches, and this was not like
those.</p>

<p>“The fine moral reaction,” she said, “has
at last come. It has come in a remorse too
tardy to reclaim all the human life that has
been spent. It has come in a remorse too
tardy to reclaim the treasure that has been
wasted. But it comes too with a sense of
joy that all voluntary destruction of human
life, all the deliberate wasting of the fruits of
labor, will soon have become things of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
past. Whatever the future holds for us, it
will at least be free from war.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Of this the Inger understood nothing.
What could she be talking about, when the
United States was to go to war at once?</p>

<p>“... it is because women understand that
this is so, that we have been able so to come
together. Not a month ago the word went
out. Yet every state in the United States
is represented here in Washington to-day by
from one to five hundred women. And no
one has talked about it. No one has wondered
or speculated. We are here because
the time has come.”</p>

<p>And now the Inger thought he understood.
They were here to help! The time <i>had</i>
come&mdash;war was here&mdash;they had come here
to be ready, to collect supplies, to make
bandages....</p>

<p>“... seven women from seven of the
warring nations of Europe,” the quiet voice
went on, “and women of the other states of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Europe answered our appeal, and they are
here. They will speak to us to-night&mdash;and
they are to go from state to state, helping
all women to understand.”</p>

<p>Women from the warring nations! The
Inger looked eagerly. They had been there,
they had seen, they had cheered their husbands
and sons. Some of them must have
lost their men&mdash;of course they could tell the
American women what to do.</p>

<p>The first woman, however, was not of a
warring country. She was a woman of Denmark.
And she was of the same quiet manner
and conversational speech.</p>

<p>She said: “During the first day of the
war an old man said to me, sad and indignant:
‘To me it is quite unintelligible that citizens
of the twentieth century consent to be driven
like sheep to the shambles.’ And truly, only
a fraction of those involved in the war did
intend the war. To them and to us it was a
surprise that will repeat itself in history as
long as war is declared without the consent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of the people, as long as war depends on
secret notes and treaties.</p>

<p>“Where can we find a way to prevent another
happening of these terrors? Can women
possibly have any chance of succeeding where
men have recently failed so miserably?</p>

<p>“I came from Denmark to say to you that
women have better opportunities than anybody
else for creating public opinion&mdash;the
opinion that grows stronger with the coming
race. Women give the next generation its
first impressions.</p>

<p>“And the mother must give her children
another idea than the armed warrior. Let
her show them how unworthy it is of the
citizen of the twentieth century to be used,
body and blood, without will or resistance,
as food for cannon....”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The Inger listened, stupefied. What was
this woman saying? It sounded to him like
treason for which they should fall on her and
drive her from the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he heard the country of the next
woman who came forward. Germany! Now
they would hear the truth. Here was a
woman from a nation of soldiers. She would
understand, and she would make the rest
know in what lay a country’s glory. Moreover,
she was a strong woman&mdash;a woman to
whom that race of mothers and of soldiers
might have looked as the mother of them all.</p>

<p>“Women of the World, when will your call
ring out?</p>

<p>“Women of all the belligerent states, with
head high and courageous heart, gave their
husbands to protect the fatherland. Mothers
and maidens unfalteringly saw their sons and
sweethearts go forth to death and destruction.”</p>

<p>This was it! The Inger drew his breath
deep. She knew&mdash;she knew.... She
wanted American women to feel the same.</p>

<p>“Millions of men have been left on the
battlefield. They will never see home again.
Others have returned, broken and sick in
body and soul. Towns of the highest civilization,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
homes of simple human happiness, are
destroyed. Europe’s soil reeks of human
blood. The flesh and blood of men will fertilize
the soil of the corn fields of the future
on German, French, Belgian and Russian
ground.</p>

<p>“Millions of women’s hearts blaze up in
anguish. No human speech is rich enough
to express such depths of suffering. Shall
this war of extermination go on? Shall we
sit and wait dumbly for other wars to come
upon us?</p>

<p>“Women of the world, where is your voice?</p>

<p>“Are you only great in patience and
suffering?</p>

<p>“The earth soaked in blood, millions of
wrecked bodies of husbands, sweethearts,
sons&mdash;outrages inflicted on your sex. Can
these things not rouse you to blazing protest?</p>

<p>“Women of the world, where is your voice,
that should be sowing seeds of peace? Do
not let yourselves be deterred by those who
accuse you of weakness because you wish for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
peace, who say you cannot hold back the
bloody march of history by your protest.</p>

<p>“Protest with all your might ... make
preparation for peace ... perform your
duty as wives and mothers, as protectors of
true civilization and humanity!”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Still in that silence, she ceased&mdash;but now
once more all over the hall, the women rose,
and stood there for a moment, looking into
the eyes of the woman of Germany. There
was no handclapping, there was no word,
there was only that single sign&mdash;as if in that
room there were but one Person, and that
Person answered like this to what she said.</p>

<p>The Inger stared about him. What did
this mean? Were these a few traitors who
had come here to teach American women to
play traitor too&mdash;</p>

<p>The German woman was speaking again.</p>

<p>“A letter,” she said, “a letter from German
and Austrian women, ‘to the women of
England&mdash;and of the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>’”</p>

<p>She read: “Women, creators and guardians
of life, must loathe war, which destroys
life. Through the smoke of battle
and thunder of cannon of hostile peoples,
through death, terror, destruction and unending
pain and anxiety, there glows like the dawn
of a coming better day the deep community
of feeling of many women of all nations.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>“This is signed,” she said, “by one hundred
and fifty German and Austrian women. Thousands
more are with us in name and spirit.
Do not doubt&mdash;doubt!”</p>

<p>Another woman rose, and then another:</p>

<p>A letter from the women of England&mdash;</p>

<p>“... Is it not our mission to preserve life?
Do not humanity and common sense alike
prompt us to join hands with the women of
neutral countries, and urge the stay of further
bloodshed&mdash;forever?... There is but
one way to do this ... by Wisdom and
Reason. Can they begin too soon?...
Already we seem to hear</p>

‘A hundred nations swear that there shall be<br />
Pity and Peace and Love among the good and free.’”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Then a letter from the women of Belgium,
from the women of Switzerland, from the
women of Italy&mdash;five hundred, two thousand
names to each.</p>

<p>At length the Inger understood. These
women who were here to protest against war
were speaking for thousands upon thousands
of women all over the world. And here
were thousands listening, in the nation’s
capitol.</p>

<p>A little French woman spoke, each sentence
translated by another woman.</p>

<p>“The humblest cry can sometimes be
heard joined to many others.... It is very
well for gentlemen banqueting at Guildhall
to rejoice at being able to assemble so comfortably
during the greatest war in history,
thanks to the valor of the British army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
which defends the coast; but they should
think of those who are exposing their lives....</p>

<p>“My two sons are in the trenches since the
end of September, and have never slept in a
bed since. It would be nothing if the cold
had not set in so dreadfully....”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Something&mdash;no one could have told
whether it was a breath, or a look from one to
one, went over the hall. More than in a long
account of horror, this French mother, who
spoke no other tongue, had made them feel
what she was feeling.</p>

<p>There was a Polish woman of the country
about Cracow who told the story of what had
happened to her village. She spoke slowly,
through an interpreter, and almost without
emotion.</p>

<p>“We had just three little streets,” she said,
“so it was not much to take. But they took
them....” And she told how, and how a
hundred children in the village had died.
“I should be less than a woman in courage if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
I did not say that I, for one, shall not be silent
even one day until my death. Every day I
shall be crying, ‘Women of the World. This
can not happen again, if we are women of
flesh and not of stone.’”</p>

<p>There was a woman of Servia, and she was
a peasant woman. Her clothes were those
which her neighbors had found for her. Even
then, so great was the haste at the last, she
had crossed the ocean in a skirt and a shawl,
but with no waist beneath the shawl.</p>

<p>“I had to come,” she said, through her
interpreter. “There is only one hell worse
than the hell that we have been through:
and that is not to cry to the last breath that
it shall be stopped. That it shall not come
again to other women like us....”</p>

<p>There was a woman of Belgium, who belonged
to a family high in position in Louvain.
She wore garments which had been
given to her from the American boxes. It
was strange to hear that soft voice, in its
broken English, speak of a thousand horrors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
with no passion. But when she spoke of
To-morrow, and of what it must bring, her
voice throbbed and strove with the spirit
which poured through her.</p>

<p>“Do not think of Louvain,” she said.
“Do not think of Belgium. Say, if you like,
that this was only a part of what happens in
war. Think, then, only of war. Think that
war must not be ever again in this our world.
While women have voices to raise to other
women, we must make them understand that
peace is our contribution to the earth. Women
of the world, what are we waiting for?”</p>

<p>Then there came a woman, young, erect,
burning&mdash;a woman of Hungary.</p>

<p>“Listen,” she said. “A Hungarian girl who
went to care for the Galician refugees tells me
in a recent letter the story of a poor woman
who said: ‘I wanted to protect my children.
I ran with the other inhabitants of the village.
I took my baby in a shawl on my back. The
two others hung on to my skirts. I ran fast,
as fast as I could. When I got to the station,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
I had the two children hanging on my skirts,
I had the shawl on my back, but I had no baby
and I don’t know where I dropped him.’”</p>

<p>The Hungarian woman went on:</p>

<p>“They don’t want us to find out that there
is no glory, no big patriotism, no love for
anything noble, nothing but butchery and
slaughter and rape. War means that. You
know the story of the War-brides. You
know how agents of the different churches
compete with military rulers in glorifying this
kind of prostitution. But do you know of
the concentration camps with the compulsory
service of women? You may have seen the
full reports of the atrocities committed on
Belgian women&mdash;but you didn’t get the
other reports about the same kind of atrocities
committed by <i>all</i> armies on female
human beings between the ages of five and
eighty-nine in all the countries where the
game of war is being played. <i>Women of the
world, what are we waiting for?</i>”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>And beside her, as she finished, stood an
Irish woman, taking up the thread of the
Hungarian’s woman’s cry:</p>

<p>“If we women, to whom even a partial
knowledge of these happenings has come,
remain silent now, then we are blood guilty.
We are more than blood guilty, for we must
be numbered with those who will even dare
the murder of a soul.</p>

<p>“Let us not blind ourselves with talk of
the glories and heroisms of war. We dare not
ignore the moral and spiritual wreckage that
remains unchronicled. We have to think of
men brutalized and driven to hideous deeds
by their experiences; of men with reason
destroyed; of men disgraced for lack of the
cold courage that can face such horrors; of
men with a slain faith in good, their outlook on
life eternally embittered. What of the women
for whom the French government has had to
devise legislation to deter them from infanticide?
What of the children begotten under
such conditions? Women of the world, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
is your voice, that should be sowing the seeds
of peace?”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Almost as her own voice, went on the
voice of another woman, the brief poignant
entreaty of an English woman:</p>

<p>“<i>We ask nothing strange!</i> Only that
which Christianity, civilization and motherhood
dictate.</p>

<p>“The well-being of children touches all.
On that common ground the opposing nations
could meet and crown their courage by laying
aside their arms at the call of a higher humanity.</p>

<p>“Can mother hearts turn from this cry?
Will not womanhood join in resolve, though
in divers tongues, yet with but one Voice&mdash;the
Voice of pure human love and pity....”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The Inger stood against the wall, and
listened. A place had opened into which he
had never looked, whose existence he had
never guessed. He stood frowning, staring&mdash;at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
first trying to understand, then understanding
and passionately doubting. The
appeals of the first speakers did not touch
him. What did women know of these things?</p>

<p>Then the Polish woman had spoken. Then
the Servian woman. Then the Belgium
woman. These undeniably knew what they
were talking about! But not until that
woman of Hungary had stood there, did the
thought come which had pierced him: What
if all that she said was true&mdash;and was true
of Lory? What if it had been her child
whom Lory had lost from her shawl as she
ran....</p>

<p>He breathed hard, and looked about him.
They were all, men and women alike, sitting as
tense as he. And he saw that all these believed.
No one, no one could doubt these women.</p>

<p>“This is what we have to do&mdash;” it was
another German woman who was speaking
and the interpreter was giving her words.
“This is what we have to do: our cry must
ring forth irresistibly from millions of voices:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
‘Enough of slaughter, enough of devastation.
Peace, lasting peace! Make room for peaceful
work. Leave the way free for the fraternity
of the peoples and for their coöperation
in bringing to flower the culture of
international civilization!’</p>

<p>“If men kill, it is for women to fight for
the preservation of life. If men are silent,
it is our duty to raise our voices on behalf of
our ideals.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The Inger stood where the wall curved, so
he was looking at the rows of faces from near
the front of the room. And he was looking
on a sign, a hint no greater in emphasis than
a shadow, of what war is to women. He
understood it, momentarily he even felt it.
And for a flash he saw them all as he had seen
the women in the Chicago employment agency&mdash;as
if he were those women and could
suffer what they suffered.</p>

<p>He remembered Lory, and her face lifted
to his in the Chicago meeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’re voting to kill folks,” she had said.
“Oh, my God.”</p>

<p>This was what she had meant. She had
understood, and he had not understood.
How had she understood? He thought about
her. Out of Inch, out of scenes of killing,
and of misery put upon life, Jem Moor’s girl
had come, and she knew how to feel the way
these women felt. All that he had been feeling
for her became something which beat upon
his heart like light.</p>

<p>A note had been sent to the chairman, and
with her announcement, a movement of
wonder went over the audience, and this
wonder was touched with dread. A famous
army man was present, and he would speak.</p>

<p>He came forward firmly, and it was by the
merest chance that he stood there before
them erect, strong, compact, alive, for he
had seen service. The Inger looked at him,
quickening. Immediately, at the sight of
his uniform, the Inger had felt a restoration
of confidence in what had always been.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Then the man faced them, and he spoke as
quietly as the women themselves:</p>

<p>“I ask only to tell you,” he said, “that I
have been for twenty-five years in the service&mdash;a
part of the time in active service. I have
believed in armies and in armament. I still
believe them to have been an obvious necessity&mdash;while
our world was being whipped
into shape. Now I am in the last years of
my service&mdash;I do not take very readily to
new ideas&mdash;even when I know that these
point to the next step on the way. I tell
you frankly, that if there were a call to arms,
I should be there in my old place&mdash;I should
serve as I have always served, I should kill
whom they told me to kill, as long as they
would have me there. But&mdash;” he hesitated,
and lifted his face, and in it was a light that
has shone on a face in no battlefield, “if that
time comes, I shall thank God for every
woman who protests against it, as you here
are protesting. And, if that time comes,
from my soul I shall honor the men who will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
have the courage to be shot, rather than to
go out to shoot their fellows. These men
will not be lacking: I have read the signs and
I have heard men talk. Your new way of
warfare is not in vain. You will win. You
are the voice of To-morrow. I have wanted
you to know that I feel this&mdash;and that to
you and to your effort I say God bless you,
and prosper what you do.”</p>

<p>For the first time that night the silence of
the audience was broken. A thunder of
hands and voices spoke to him. And, as he
turned to leave the platform, they did that by
which they paid the highest honor that they
knew&mdash;and rose and remained standing until
he had reached his seat.</p>

<p>“Jove,” said the man near the Inger.
“Old Battle-axe! Now watch the men catch
up. It only needed one full-blooded man to
say it....”</p>

<p>“Rot,” said the man beyond him. “No
matter what they say, you know and I know
that trade will never get out of the way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
peace. There’ll be no peace while we have
trade&mdash;and that’ll be for some time to
come!”</p>

<p>At this the first man laughed.</p>

<p>“Trade,” he said, “was a thought before
it was trade. Peace is a thought&mdash;yet.”</p>

<p>On the stage some one was quoting Washington:
“My first wish is&mdash;to see the whole
world in peace and the inhabitants of it as
one band of brothers, striving who should
contribute most to the happiness of mankind.”</p>

<p>And Victor Hugo: “A day will come
when a cannon ball will be exhibited in
public museums, just as an instrument of
torture is now; and people will be amazed
that such a thing could ever have been.”</p>

<p>Methodically, and as if it had become their
business, the women fell to discussing what
they must do. In each country more groups
must be organized&mdash;for School, Home,
States, Municipalities&mdash;“for the lifting of
the programme of pacifism into the realm of
serious commercial and educational and home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and political consideration.” The psychology
of war must give place to the psychology of
peace.</p>

<p>From unfair trade legislation by one country
against another, down to the sale of toy
weapons and soldiers; and from competing
expenditures for national defence down to
military drill in schools and colleges, the
temptations to militarism must pass from
the earth.</p>

<p>“We know,” an American woman said,
“that war depends on economic conditions
beyond our control. But we know, too, that
there is something potent to change even
these, and it is this potency which we dream
to liberate.”</p>

<p>And, beside the Inger, the man said again:</p>

<p>“Peace is only a thought,&mdash;yet. But
even economic conditions were only thought,
once!”</p>

<p>Gradually in the voice of one and another,
the word took shape&mdash;so simply that the
enormity of the import was pathetically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
lacking: That representatives of the women
of the world, united in a demand for international
righteousness, shall petition the
men and women of the world to turn to
the new knowledge that war is an outworn
way to settle difficulties; that with
one voice we shall all refuse any longer
to let the traditions of a past age be
put upon us; that the old phrases and
catch-words shall not stand for one moment
before the naked question of the race:
“Is this the best that life can do with
life?” That we shall learn from one another
that there is no such thing as preparing
against war, but that to prepare for war
breeds war&mdash;twin-born are the slayer and
the slain; that we shall teach one another
that “Thou shalt not kill” is not only moral
law, but sound economic policy, for always
these two are one. And that from the
constructive plans devised in anguish and
in hope by men and women of to-day,
there be selected and inaugurated a world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
programme for permanent peace without
armistice and a council of the nations looking
toward the federation of the world.</p>

<p>“We have talked long enough of treaties
and of arbitration,” they said. “Let us have
done with such play. Let us speak the phrase
quite simply: The federation of the world.”</p>

<p>And the message concluded:</p>

<p>“For we, the women of the world, have
banded ourselves together to demand that
war be abolished.”</p>

<p>Last, he remembered a Voice. Afterward,
he could not have told what woman spoke, or
of what nation they said that she had come.
But what she said was like the weaving of
what the others had spun.</p>

<p>“<i>Remember,</i>” said her Voice, “<i>that all this
is nothing. It is only the body, made for the
spirit. And the spirit is that new dominant
mind which shall be born in the world&mdash;the
mind of love.</i></p>

<p>“<i>You’ll not get this by going to governments.
You’ll not get this by the meeting of groups of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
representative people. You’ll not get this by
International Police. These things must be&mdash;will
be, as a matter of course. But they will
not be the mind of love.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Something will come into the world&mdash;and
it will know nothing of arbitration, it will
know nothing of armistice, it will know nothing
of treaties; nor will it know anything of those
other ways of secret warfare by which great nations
seem to keep clean hands: the ways of ‘high’
finance through ‘peaceful penetration.’</i></p>

<p>“<i>Something will come into the world, and it
will know nothing of nations.</i></p>

<p>“<i>The little loyalties will go. National pride,
national ‘honor,’ patriotism&mdash;all the little
scaffolds will fall away. And within will be
the light that we lack.</i></p>

<p>“<i>It is the mind of love. I am not afraid to
say that beside it, governments are nothing.
It is the mind of love. It may be in the simplest
cottage of a peasant who goes to the war for a
false ideal. But of this as yet the nations do
not know.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>What is it that we must know?</i></p>

<p>“<i>That the nations are nothing&mdash;the people
are everything. That the people are bound
together by ties which the nations must cease
to break. That the people are heart’s kindred,
met here together for their world-work, and that
the nations must cease to interrupt.</i>”</p>

<p class="p2">Even then the Cabinet meeting was already
concluded, and the newsboys were on the
streets with the Extras; and on the bulletin
boards of the world the word was being
flashed:</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">“NO ACTION TO BE TAKEN<br />
BY U. S.”</p>

<p class="p1">And in the newspapers was the text of that
letter, simple, human, of almost religious import,
which was to make the United States,
years hence, stand out as the first great headland
upon new shores.</p>

<p class="p2">The people were coming out at the doors
of the Capitol. Among them were the women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
who had spoken&mdash;the Polish woman, the
Servian peasant, the lady of Louvain. The
other women in the crowd put out their
hands and took the hands of these women.
Those stretching, pressing hands of silent
women marked a giant fellowship which
disregarded oceans, strange tongues, countless
varying experiences, and took account of only
one thing.</p>

<p>The Inger was looking up at the white
dome against the black sky, and about him
at the march of the people. Through his
thought ran the flood of this that he had
heard. In his absorption he lurched heavily
against a man who was trying to pass him and
who jostled him. For the first time in his
life, the Inger felt no surge of anger at such
a happening. He looked in the man’s face.</p>

<p>“Gosh,” the Inger said. “That was too
alfired bad!”</p>

<p>The man smiled and nodded. Momentarily,
the Inger felt on his arm the touch of
the man’s hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, brother,” the man said, and
was gone.</p>

<p>The Inger felt a sudden lightness of heart.
And about him the people went along so
quietly. Abruptly the tumult of his thinking
gave way to something nearer than these
things. He looked in their faces. None of
them knew that his father had died! It
occurred to him now that there was hardly
one of them who, on being told, would not
say something to him&mdash;perhaps even shake
his hand. He thought that many of these
people must have seen their fathers die. He
wondered which ones these would be, and
he wished that he knew which ones they
were. Something in him went along with
the people, because they must have had
fathers who had died. He looked at them
in a new way. Their fathers must have
died....</p>

<p>Oh, if only, he thought, Lory might have
been there to-night with those women who
felt as she felt....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>He was aware of a hand on his arm. He
turned, feeling an obscure pleasure that perhaps
some one had something to say to him.
It was Lory, alone.</p>

<h2 class="p4">X</h2>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Her</span> face in the darkness, and about them
the green gloom of the Square, were all
that he knew of the time. Not far from
them, like murals on the night, went the
people, that little lighted stream of people,
down the white steps and along the gray
drives.</p>

<p>At first he could say nothing to her. He
seized at her hand as he had seized upon it that
night in Chicago, but then he remembered and
let her hand fall; and at last he blurted out a
consuming question:</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Who?” Lory asked surprisingly, and
understood, and still more surprisingly replied:</p>

<p>“Bunchy! He’s gone to New York.”</p>

<p>This city’s name the Inger repeated stupidly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
and as if it made no answer to anything.</p>

<p>“Just for a few days,” she explained,
“before he goes home.”</p>

<p>“Home!”</p>

<p>To tell the truth she seemed not to be
thinking very much about Bunchy.</p>

<p>“I told him I’d never marry him&mdash;not
in fifty hundred years. And he went
home.”</p>

<p>He considered this incredulously.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you tell him that without
comin’ clear to Washington to do it?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “There was the money.
Why didn’t you tell me you’d give Dad that
money?”</p>

<p>He tried to answer her, but all the while
this miracle was taking him to itself: Bunchy
had gone.</p>

<p>“I guess because it sounded like a square
deal, when I only done it to devil Bunchy
some,” he told her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is that all you done it for?”</p>

<p>He looked at her swiftly. Was that all
that he had done it for?</p>

<p>“Is it?” she said.</p>

<p>“I donno,” he answered truthfully. “It
was some of it.”</p>

<p>“I wish,” she said, “I wish’t I knew.”</p>

<p>With that he moved a little toward her,
and tried to see her face.</p>

<p>“Why?” he asked.</p>

<p>She turned away and said nothing. And
when she did that, he caught his breath and
stooped to her.</p>

<p>“You tell me why you wish’t you knew,”
he bade her.</p>

<p>“Oh well,” she said&mdash;and she was breathless
too&mdash;“if you done it to help me&mdash;get
away&mdash;then I shouldn’t feel so bad about
goin’ to the hut.”</p>

<p>“About comin’ to me?”</p>

<p>“About makin’ you do all this for me!”
she cried. “I’m sick over it. I don’t know
how to tell you....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>He wondered if it was possible that she did
not understand.</p>

<p>“I done the only thing I could think
to do,” she said. “There wasn’t anybody
else....”</p>

<p>“Do you get the idea,” he demanded,
“that I’m ever going to forget how you said
that to me that first night? I was drunk&mdash;but
I knew when you said that. And then&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” she said.</p>

<p>“How can I help it?” he asked bitterly.
“I made fool enough of myself that night&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>Don’t</i>,” she begged.</p>

<p>“&mdash;so’s you never can forget it,” he
finished. “And so’s I never can. If it hadn’t
been for that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What then?” she asked.</p>

<p>And now he did not answer, but looked
away from her, and so it was she who made
him tell.</p>

<p>“What then?” she said again.</p>

<p>“<i>Would</i> you have liked me then,” he burst
out, “before that night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>She said&mdash;and nothing could have swept
him like the simplicity and honesty of this:</p>

<p>“But you never come down to town once
after that morning on the horse.”</p>

<p>“How did you know that?” he cried.</p>

<p>“I watched,” she answered, quietly.</p>

<p>And yet this, he knew, was before that
night on the trail. This was still in the
confidence of her supreme confession: “I
didn’t know no woman I could tell&mdash;nor no
other decent man.” And she had watched
for him....</p>

<p>But, after all, she was telling him so <i>now</i>!
And here, to-night, when she no longer had
need of him, her comradeship was unchanged.
And there had been those hours on the train
from Chicago....</p>

<p>“You watched!” he repeated. “Oh look
here! Would you watch&mdash;now?”</p>

<p>To her voice came that tremor that he
remembered, which seemed to be in the very
words themselves.</p>

<p>“I watched all day to-day,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Even then he did not touch her. It was
as if there were some gulf which she must
be the one to cross.</p>

<p>“Oh Lory, Lory!” he cried.</p>

<p>And she understood, and it was she who
stretched out her hands to him.</p>

<p>In their broken talk, he told her of his
father, and she clung to him with a cry that
she had not been with him.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t send for you,” she said. “I
thought&mdash;maybe you was glad Bunchy come.
I thought maybe you was glad I was off your
hands&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My hands,” he said, “just was huntin’
for your hands.”</p>

<p>“Then that ice-cream place’s wife,” she
said, “told me about to-night&mdash;and somebody
told Aunt ’Cretia. And we come here
to the meeting&mdash;but when I saw you, I run
and lost ’em&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I wanted you when I was in that meeting,”
he told her, “more’n any other time,
most. I knew you knew what they meant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>She said the thing which in the tense
feeling of that hour, had remained for her
paramount.</p>

<p>“That woman,” she cried, “with her baby
in her shawl! <i>Think</i>&mdash;when she knew it
was gone&mdash;and she couldn’t go back....”</p>

<p>“I thought&mdash;what if it had been you,” he
told her.</p>

<p>She was in his arms, close in the dusk of a
great cedar. “Any woman&mdash;any woman!”
she said, and he felt her sobbing.</p>

<p>He turned and looked away at the people.
Not far from them, like murals on the night,
went the people, that little lighted stream of
people, down the white steps and along the
gray drives. He looked at the women. That
about the baby in the shawl might have
happened to any one of them, if war were
here.... It was terrible to think that this
might happen to any one of these women.
He felt as if he knew them. And then too,
there must be some of them whose fathers
had died....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>He kept looking at the people, and in his
arms was Lory, sobbing for that woman who
had lost her child from her shawl; and
over there across the water were thousands
whose children were gone, whose fathers had
died....</p>

<p>Here they all seemed so kindly, and they
were going home ... to homes such as he
and Lory were going to have. <i>Just the
same&mdash;just the same</i>....</p>

<p>And as he looked at the people, the thousands,
going to their homes, Love that had
come to dwell in him, touched him on the
eyes. He saw them loving, as he and Lory
loved. He saw them grieving, as that woman
had grieved for her child. He saw them lonely
for their dead, as he was lonely for his dead.
None of them could deceive him. He knew
them, now. They were like Lory and like him.</p>

<p>Out of a heart suddenly full he spoke the
utmost that he could:</p>

<p>“What a rotten shame,” he said, “it’d be
to kill any of them!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked up, and saw where he was
looking, and her heart leaped with her understanding
of him.</p>

<p>He was trying to think it out.</p>

<p>“But they can’t seem to stop to think of
things like that,” he said; “not when big
things come up.”</p>

<p>“Big things!” she cried. “What’s big
things?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;rights&mdash;and land&mdash;and sea-ports,”
said he.</p>

<p>She laughed, and caught up an end of her
blue knitted shawl and covered her face, and
dropped the shawl with almost a sob.</p>

<p>“Rights&mdash;and land&mdash;and sea-ports!” she
said over.</p>

<p>The three words hung in air, and echoed.
And abruptly there came upon him a dozen
things that he had heard that night: “We
had just three little streets, but they took
those....” “There is only one hell worse
than we have been through....” “Say,
if you like, that Belgium was only a part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
what happens in war....” “We have to
think of men brutalized and driven to hideous
deeds....” “Enough of slaughter. Enough
of devastation. Peace&mdash;lasting peace!”
And then again the words of the Hungarian
woman: “I had the shawl on my back, but
I had no baby and I don’t know where I
dropped him.”</p>

<p>“Think of millions of men doing like Dad
and that sheriff,” the girl said suddenly.
“I saw ’em there on the woodshed floor,&mdash;stark,
starin’, ravin’ mad.”</p>

<p>Sharp on the dark before him was struck
the image of that old madman in the kitchen.
There was a beast in him. The Inger had
felt the beast in himself answer. He had
felt the shame of a man who is a beast to
another man. <i>What if it were the same kind
of shame for the nations?</i></p>

<p>Suddenly, in his arms, Lory was pouring
out all that she had longed to say to him.</p>

<p>“Back there in Inch,” she cried, “I knew
there was some other way. I had to know!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
It didn’t seem as if everybody could be like
Dad and Bunchy. Then I saw you&mdash;and
you seemed like you could be some other
way. And you are&mdash;and see the folks
there. There <i>is</i> some other way to be besides
killin’!”</p>

<p>The lights in the dome went out, and that
high white presence dropped back against
the sky. Still the people were going by,
their feet treading the gravel; and now there
was a man’s voice, now a woman’s voice, now
the sleepy treble of a child. And they were
all in some exquisite faith of destination.</p>

<p>“I guess there must be some other way,”
the Inger said.</p>

<p>To the man and the woman in each other’s
arms, there came no glimpse of the future,
great with its people, “striving who should
contribute most to the happiness of mankind.”
But of the man’s love was born his
dim knowledge&mdash;which had long been the
woman’s knowledge&mdash;that the people are
bound together by ties which the nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
must cease to break. That the people are
heart’s kindred, met here for their world-work,
which the nations must cease to interrupt.</p>

<p>Yet all that he could say of this was something
which every soldier knows&mdash;though
armies never know:</p>

<p>“If that woman had been you&mdash;and the
baby in the shawl had been ours&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Anybody’s!” she insisted. “Anybody’s
baby!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Inger then. “Anybody’s
baby.!”</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
